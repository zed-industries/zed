Okay, I need to create an empty file named "1" in the zed directory. The user confirmed that they want this file created. Since the file is supposed to be empty, I just need to write an empty string as its content. Let me make sure there are no other requirements or details missed. The user specified that the response should be the file's content directly without any explanations. So, I'll output nothing but an empty string.

```zed/1
