We are not obligated to respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request.

We are committed to respond to Valid Requests within the time frame required by applicable law. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.

You may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:

- Email us at: hi@zed.dev

If you are a California resident, you may also authorize an agent (an "Authorized Agent") to exercise your rights on your behalf.
