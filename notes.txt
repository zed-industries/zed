Editor has a `start_temporary_diff_override`

there is:
- [ ] text_diff_view (clipboard vs selection diffing)
- [ ] file_diff_view
- [ ] toggle_single_diff_hunk -> ... -> sync_diff_transforms

there is something called diff_transform on MultiBuffer no idea what it does


editorelement prepaint contains:
```rust
let background_color = match diff_status.kind {
    DiffHunkStatusKind::Added => cx.theme().colors().version_control_added,
    DiffHunkStatusKind::Deleted => {
        cx.theme().colors().version_control_deleted
    }
    DiffHunkStatusKind::Modified => {
        debug_panic!("modified diff status for row info");
        continue;
    }
};
```

^ That only has to do with staging


There is `decoration_runs` in `paint_line_background`. They seem to be for coloring the background of only some glyphs

adding this unconditionally in paint_line_background makes the background of every first character in the line blue :party
```
let mut decoration_runs: Vec<_> = decoration_runs.iter().cloned().collect();
decoration_runs.insert(
    0,
    DecorationRun {
        len: 1,
        color: Hsla::black(),
        background_color: Some(Hsla::blue()),
        underline: None,
        strikethrough: None,
    },
);
let decoration_runs = decoration_runs.as_slice();
```

`self.paint_lines(&invisible_display_ranges, layout, window, cx)` draws
- the red diff (text and background)
- the current text (only text)
The green background for the current text is drawn elsewhere.


quite intresting:
```
let chunks = snapshot.highlighted_chunks(rows.clone(), true, style);
LineWithInvisibles::from_chunks(
```
slightly above that a TextRun is made
