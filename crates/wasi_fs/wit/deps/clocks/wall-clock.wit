/// WASI Wall Clock is a clock API intended to let users query the current
/// time. The name "wall" makes an analogy to a "clock on the wall", which
/// is not necessarily monotonic as it may be reset.

/// It is intended to be portable at least between Unix-family platforms and
/// Windows.
///
/// A wall clock is a clock which measures the date and time according to
/// some external reference.
///
/// External references may be reset, so this clock is not necessarily
/// monotonic, making it unsuitable for measuring elapsed time.
///
/// It is intended for reporting the current date and time for humans.
