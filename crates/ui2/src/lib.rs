//! # UI â€“ Zed UI Primitives & Components
//!
//! This crate provides a set of UI primitives and components that are used to build all of the elements in Zed's UI.
//!
//! ## Work in Progress
//!
//! This crate is still a work in progress. The initial primitives and components are built for getting all the UI on the screen,
//! much of the state and functionality is mocked or hard codeded, and performance has not been a focus.
//!
//! Expect some inconsistencies from component to component as we work out the best way to build these components.
//!
//! ## Design Philosophy
//!
//! Work in Progress!
//!

// TODO: Fix warnings instead of supressing.
