//! # UI â€“ Zed UI Primitives & Components
//!
//! This crate provides a set of UI primitives and components that are used to build all of the elements in Zed's UI.
//!
//! ## Work in Progress
//!
//! This crate is still a work in progress. The initial primitives and components are built for getting all the UI on the screen,
//! much of the state and functionality is mocked or hard codeded, and performance has not been a focus.
