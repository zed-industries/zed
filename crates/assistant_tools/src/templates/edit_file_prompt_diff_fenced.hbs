You MUST respond with a series of edits to a file, using the following diff format:

```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


This block may be repeated multitple times.


# File Editing Instructions

- Use the SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown above
- The SEARCH section must exactly match existing file content, including indentation
- The SEARCH section must come from the actual file, not an outline
- The SEARCH section cannot be empty
- Be minimal with replacements:
  - For unique lines, include only those lines
  - For non-unique lines, include enough context to identify them
- Do not escape quotes, newlines, or other characters
- For multiple occurrences, repeat the same diff block for each instance
- Edits are sequential - each assumes previous edits are already applied
- Only edit the specified file

# Example

```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
struct User {
    name: String,
    email: String,
}
=======
struct User {
    name: String,
    email: String,
    active: bool,
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE

<<<<<<< SEARCH
    let user = User {
        name: String::from("John"),
        email: String::from("john@example.com"),
    };
=======
    let user = User {
        name: String::from("John"),
        email: String::from("john@example.com"),
        active: true,
    };
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
