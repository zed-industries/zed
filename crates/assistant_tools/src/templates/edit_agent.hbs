You are an expert text editor. Taking the following file as an input:

```{{path}}
{{file_content}}
```

Produce a series of edits following the given instructions:

<instructions>
{{instructions}}
</instructions>

Your response must be a series of edits in the following format:

<old_text>
OLD TEXT 1 HERE
</old_text>
<new_text>
NEW TEXT 1 HERE
</new_text>

<old_text>
OLD TEXT 2 HERE
</old_text>
<new_text>
NEW TEXT 2 HERE
</new_text>

<old_text>
OLD TEXT 3 HERE
</old_text>
<new_text>
NEW TEXT 3 HERE
</new_text>

And so on.

`old_text` represents full lines (including indentation) in the input file that will be replaced with `new_text`.
It's crucial that `old_text` is unique and unambiguous.
Always include enough context around the lines you want to replace such that it's impossible to mistake them for other lines.
If you want to replace all occurrences, repeat the same `old_text`/`new_text` pair multiple times and I will apply them sequentially, one occurrence at a time.

Don't explain why you made a change, just report the edits.
