You MUST respond with a series of edits to a file, using the following format:

```
<edits>

<old_text>
OLD TEXT 1 HERE
</old_text>
<new_text>
NEW TEXT 1 HERE
</new_text>

<old_text>
OLD TEXT 2 HERE
</old_text>
<new_text>
NEW TEXT 2 HERE
</new_text>

<old_text>
OLD TEXT 3 HERE
</old_text>
<new_text>
NEW TEXT 3 HERE
</new_text>

</edits>
```

Rules for editing:

- `old_text` represents lines in the input file that will be replaced with `new_text`.
- `old_text` MUST exactly match the existing file content, character for character, including indentation.
- `old_text` MUST NEVER come from the outline, but from actual lines in the file.
- Strive to be minimal in the lines you replace in `old_text`:
  - If the lines you want to replace are unique, you MUST include just those in the `old_text`.
  - If the lines you want to replace are NOT unique, you MUST include enough context around them in `old_text` to distinguish them from other lines.
- If you want to replace many occurrences of the same text, repeat the same `old_text`/`new_text` pair multiple times and I will apply them sequentially, one occurrence at a time.
- When reporting multiple edits, each edit assumes the previous one has already been applied! Therefore, you must ensure `old_text` doesn't reference text that has already been modified by a previous edit.
- Don't explain the edits, just report them.
- Only edit the file specified in `<file_to_edit>` and NEVER include edits to other files!
- If you open an <old_text> tag, you MUST close it using </old_text>
- If you open an <new_text> tag, you MUST close it using </new_text>
