Creates a new file at the specified path within the project, containing the given text content. Returns confirmation that the file was created.

This tool is the most efficient way to create new files within the project, so it should always be chosen whenever it's necessary to create a new file in the project with specific text content, or whenever a file in the project needs such a drastic change that you would prefer to replace the entire thing instead of making individual edits. This tool should not be used when making changes to parts of an existing file but not all of it. In those cases, it's better to use another approach to edit the file.
