### Using the Assistant

Once you have configured a provider, you can interact with the provider's language models in a context editor.

To create a new context editor, use the menu in the top right of the assistant panel and the `New Context` option.

In the context editor, select a model from one of the configured providers, type a message in the `You` block, and submit with `cmd-enter` (or `ctrl-enter` on Linux).

### Inline assistant

When you're in a normal editor, you can use `ctrl-enter` to open the inline assistant.

The inline assistant allows you to send the current selection (or the current line) to a language model and modify the selection with the language model's response.

### Adding Prompts

You can customize the default prompts that are used in new context editor, by opening the `Prompt Library`.

Open the `Prompt Library` using either the menu in the top right of the assistant panel and choosing the `Prompt Library` option, or by using the `assistant: deploy prompt library` command when the assistant panel is focused.

### Viewing past contexts

You view all previous contexts by opening up the `History` tab in the assistant panel.

Open the `History` using the menu in the top right of the assistant panel and choosing the `History`.
