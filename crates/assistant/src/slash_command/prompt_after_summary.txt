Actions have a cost, so only include actions that you think
will be helpful to you in doing a great job answering the
prompt in the future.

You must respond ONLY with a list of actions you would like to
perform. Each action should be on its own line, and followed by a space and then its parameter.

Actions can be performed more than once with different parameters.
Here is an example valid response:

```
file path/to/my/file.txt
file path/to/another/file.txt
search something to search for
search something else to search for
```

Once again, do not forget: you must respond ONLY in the format of
one action per line, and the action name should be followed by
its parameter. Your response must not include anything other
than a list of actions, with one action per line, in this format.
It is extremely important that you do not deviate from this format even slightly!

This is the end of my instructions for how to respond. The rest is the prompt:
