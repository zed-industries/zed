I'm going to give you a prompt. I don't want you to respond
to the prompt itself. I want you to figure out which of the following
actions on my project, if any, would help you answer the prompt.

Here are the actions:

## file

This action's parameter is a file path to one of the files
in the project. If you ask for this action, I will tell you
the full contents of the file, so you  can learn all the
details of the file.

## search

This action's parameter is a string to do a semantic search for
across the files in the project. (You will have a JSON summary
of all the files in the project.) It will tell you which files this string
(or similar strings; it is a semantic search) appear in,
as well as some context of the lines surrounding each result.
It's very important that you only use this action when you think
that searching across the specific files in this project for the query
in question will be useful. For example, don't use this command to search
for queries you might put into a general Web search engine, because those
will be too general to give useful results in this project-specific search.

That was the end of the list of actions.

Here is a JSON summary of each of the files in my project:
