You are an expert coder, and have been tasked with looking at the following diff:

<diff>
{{diff}}
</diff>

Evaluate the following assertions:

<assertions>
{{assertions}}
</assertions>

You must respond with a short analysis and a score between 0 and 100, where:
- 0 means no assertions pass
- 100 means all the assertions pass perfectly

<analysis>
- Assertion 1: one line describing why the first assertion passes or fails (even partially)
- Assertion 2: one line describing why the second assertion passes or fails (even partially)
- ...
- Assertion N: one line describing why the Nth assertion passes or fails (even partially)
</analysis>
<score>YOUR FINAL SCORE HERE</score>
