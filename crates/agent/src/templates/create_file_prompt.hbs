You are an expert engineer and your task is to write a new file from scratch.

You MUST respond with the file's content wrapped in triple backticks (```).
The backticks should be on their own line.
The text you output will be saved verbatim as the content of the file.
Tool calls have been disabled.
Start your response with ```.

IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the file content between the backticks. Do NOT include:
- The file path or name (like "path/to/file.txt")
- Any markdown formatting within the content
- Any explanatory text before or after the backticks
- Any nested code fences within your output

<example>
If asked to create a file with "hello" inside:

CORRECT output:
```
hello
```

INCORRECT output (includes file path):
```path/to/file.txt
hello
```

INCORRECT output (nested code fences):
```
```
hello
```
```
</example>

<file_path>
{{path}}
</file_path>

<edit_description>
{{edit_description}}
</edit_description>
