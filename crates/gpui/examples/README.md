# GPUI Examples

Examples can be run from the Zed repository root:

```sh
cargo run -p gpui --example hello_world
```

## Where to start

- `hello_world` shows the basic shape of a GPUI application: create an
  `Application`, open a window, create a root view, and render a `div`.
- `input` demonstrates text input, focus, selections, clipboard actions, and
  keyboard bindings.
- `uniform_list` shows how to render a simple virtualized list.
- `testing` demonstrates `#[gpui::test]`, `TestAppContext`, actions, focus, and
  window-based tests.

## Layout and styling

- `grid_layout` demonstrates CSS-grid-style layout.
- `opacity` demonstrates opacity styling.
- `pattern` shows patterned backgrounds.
- `shadow` demonstrates box shadows.
- `text` shows styled text rendering.
- `text_layout` demonstrates text alignment, decoration, weights, and wrapping.
- `text_wrapper` shows wrapping text content.

## Interaction

- `anchor` demonstrates anchored positioning.
- `data_table` combines virtualized list rendering with table-style rows and a
  custom scrollbar.
- `drag_drop` shows draggable elements and drop targets.
- `focus_visible` demonstrates keyboard-visible focus styling.
- `mouse_pressure` demonstrates pressure-sensitive pointer input where supported.
- `popover` shows floating layers with `deferred` and `anchored`.
- `scrollable` demonstrates scrollable content.
- `tab_stop` shows keyboard tab navigation.

## Images, drawing, and animation

- `animation` demonstrates GPUI animations and animated SVG transforms.
- `gif_viewer` shows GIF rendering.
- `gradient` demonstrates linear gradients and color spaces.
- `image` shows local and remote image loading, image sizing, and asset setup.
- `image_gallery` demonstrates image caching and loading remote images.
- `image_loading` shows image loading states and asset loading.
- `painting` demonstrates custom drawing with paths and canvas.
- `svg` shows SVG rendering.

## Windows and application behavior

- `move_entity_between_windows` shows moving an entity between windows.
- `on_window_close_quit` demonstrates quitting when a window closes.
- `set_menus` shows application menu setup.
- `window` demonstrates creating normal, dialog, popup, and floating windows.
- `window_positioning` demonstrates window bounds and placement.
- `window_shadow` demonstrates window shadow styling.

## Specialized examples

These examples are useful when working on GPUI itself, but they may not be the
best starting point for new applications:

- `active_state_bug` is a focused active-state reproduction.
- `layer_shell` demonstrates Linux layer-shell windows.
- `list_example` demonstrates bottom-aligned list state and scrollbar behavior.
- `ownership_post` supports the ownership and data-flow documentation.
- `paths_bench` is a path rendering benchmark.
- `tree` renders a deep tree of nested elements.
