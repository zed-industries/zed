//! # Welcome to GPUI!
//!
//! GPUI is a hybrid immediate and retained mode, GPU accelerated, UI framework
//! for Rust, designed to support a wide variety of applications.
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! GPUI is still in active development as we work on the Zed code editor and isn't yet on crates.io.
//! You'll also need to use the latest version of stable rust. Add the following to your Cargo.toml:
//!
//! ```
//! gpui = { git = "https://github.com/zed-industries/zed" }
//! ```
//!
//! Everything in GPUI starts with an [`App`]. You can create one with [`App::new`], and
//! kick off your application by passing a callback to [`App::run`]. Inside this callback,
//! you can create a new window with [`AppContext::open_window`], and register your first root
//! view. See [gpui.rs](https://www.gpui.rs/) for a complete example.
//!
//! ## The Big Picture
//!
//! GPUI offers three different [registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics)) depending on your needs:
//!
//! - State management and communication with Models. Whenever you need to store application state
//!   that communicates between different parts of your application, you'll want to use GPUI's
//!   models. Models are owned by GPUI and are only accessible through an owned smart pointer
//!   similar to an [`Rc`]. See the [`app::model_context`] module for more information.
//!
//! - High level, declarative UI with Views. All UI in GPUI starts with a View. A view is simply
//!   a model that can be rendered, via the [`Render`] trait. At the start of each frame, GPUI
//!   will call this render method on the root view of a given window. Views build a tree of
//!   `elements`, lay them out and style them with a tailwind-style API, and then give them to
//!   GPUI to turn into pixels. See the [`elements::Div`] element for an all purpose swiss-army
//!   knife for UI.
//!
//! - Low level, imperative UI with Elements. Elements are the building blocks of UI in GPUI, and they
//!   provide a nice wrapper around an imperative API that provides as much flexibility and control as
//!   you need. Elements have total control over how they and their child elements are rendered and and
//!   can be used for making efficient views into large lists, implement custom layouting for a code editor,
//!   and anything else you can think of. See the [`element`] module for more information.
//!
//!  Each of these registers has one or more corresponding contexts that can be accessed from all GPUI services.
//!  This context is your main interface to GPUI, and is used extensively throughout the framework.
//!
//! ## Other Resources
//!
//! In addition to the systems above, GPUI provides a range of smaller services that are useful for building
//! complex applications:
//!
//! - Actions are user-defined structs that are used for converting keystrokes into logical operations in your UI.
//!   Use this for implementing keyboard shortcuts, such as cmd-q. See the [`action`] module for more information.
//! - Platform services, such as `quit the app` or `open a URL` are available as methods on the [`app::AppContext`].
//! - An async executor that is integrated with the platform's event loop. See the [`executor`] module for more information.,
//! - The [gpui::test] macro provides a convenient way to write tests for your GPUI applications. Tests also have their
//!   own kind of context, a [`TestAppContext`] which provides ways of simulating common platform input. See [`app::test_context`]
//!   and [`test`] modules for more details.
//!
//! Currently, the best way to learn about these APIs is to read the Zed source code, ask us about it at a fireside hack, or drop
//! a question in the [Zed Discord](https://discord.gg/U4qhCEhMXP). We're working on improving the documentation, creating more examples,
//! and will be publishing more guides to GPUI on our [blog](https://zed.dev/blog).
