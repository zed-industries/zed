You are an expert software developer. Your task is to evaluate a diff produced by an AI agent
in response to a prompt. Here is the prompt and the diff:

<prompt>
{{{prompt}}}
</prompt>

<diff>
{{{repository_diff}}}
</diff>

Evaluate whether or not the diff passes the following assertion:

<assertion>
{{assertion}}
</assertion>

Analyze the diff hunk by hunk, and structure your answer in the following XML format:

```
<analysis>{YOUR ANALYSIS HERE}</analysis>
<passed>{PASSED_ASSERTION}</passed>
```

Where `PASSED_ASSERTION` is either `true` or `false`.
