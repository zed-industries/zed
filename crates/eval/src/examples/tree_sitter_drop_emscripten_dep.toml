Change `compile_parser_to_wasm` to use `wasi-sdk` instead of emscripten.
Use `ureq` to download the SDK for the current platform and architecture.
Extract the archive into a sibling of `lib` inside the `tree-sitter` directory in the cache_dir.
Compile the parser to wasm using the `bin/clang` executable (or `bin/clang.exe` on windows)
that's inside of the archive.
Don't re-download the SDK if that executable already exists.

Use these clang flags: -fPIC -shared -Os -Wl,--export=tree_sitter_{language_name}

Here are the available wasi-sdk assets:
- wasi-sdk-25.0-x86_64-macos.tar.gz
- wasi-sdk-25.0-arm64-macos.tar.gz
- wasi-sdk-25.0-x86_64-linux.tar.gz
- wasi-sdk-25.0-arm64-linux.tar.gz

modify_function = """
The patch modifies the `compile_parser_to_wasm` function, removing logic for running `emscripten`,
and adding logic to download `wasi-sdk`.
"""

use_listed_assets = """
The patch implements logic for selecting from the assets listed in the prompt by detecting the
current platform and architecture.
"""

add_deps = """
The patch adds a dependency for `ureq` to the Cargo.toml, and adds an import to the top of `loader/lib.rs`
If the patch uses any other dependencies (such as `tar` or `flate2`), it also correctly adds them
to the Cargo.toml and imports them.

The agent finds the specified function `compile_parser_to_wasm` in a logical way.
It does not begin by guessing any paths to files in the codebase, but rather searches for the function by name.

As it edits the file, the agent never introduces syntax errors. It's ok if there are other compile errors,
but it should not introduce glaring issues like mismatched curly braces.
