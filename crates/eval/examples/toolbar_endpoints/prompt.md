I'm working on improving the Django CMS toolbar middleware to better support plugin management functionality. Currently, the toolbar is only enabled for specific views defined in the `TOOLBAR_URL_PREFIXES` within toolbar.py, but I've noticed we're missing support for two critical plugin-related operations: adding and editing plugins through the `cms_placeholder_add_plugin` and `cms_placeholder_edit_plugin` views. These views should have access to the toolbar object just like our other administrative actions, as they're fundamental to the content editing experience.

To implement this enhancement, we'll need to make two key changes. First, we should add both 'cms_placeholder_add_plugin' and 'cms_placeholder_edit_plugin' to the allowed URL prefixes list in cms/middleware/toolbar.py. Second, we should expand our test coverage in cms/tests/test_toolbar.py to verify that the toolbar object is properly attached to requests hitting these endpoints, maintaining consistency with how we test other toolbar-enabled views. This change will ensure a more complete and reliable toolbar experience throughout the entire plugin management workflow.
