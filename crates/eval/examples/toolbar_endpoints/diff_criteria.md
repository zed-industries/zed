1. The changes add two new URL patterns ('cms_placeholder_add_plugin' and 'cms_placeholder_edit_plugin') to the list of endpoints in the toolbar middleware configuration. These endpoints will now be recognized by the toolbar system.
2. The changes add test cases for the new toolbar endpoints in the test file. The first test case verifies that the toolbar is properly attached to requests for the 'cms_placeholder_add_plugin' admin endpoint. The test creates a mock request and checks that the toolbar attribute is present after middleware processing.
3. The changes include a second test case that verifies toolbar functionality for the 'cms_placeholder_edit_plugin' admin endpoint. Similar to the first test, it creates a mock request with plugin ID (1) and checks for the presence of the toolbar attribute after middleware processing. This maintains consistency with the existing test for 'cms_placeholder_clear_placeholder'.
