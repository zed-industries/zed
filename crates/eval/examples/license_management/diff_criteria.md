1. The file `.reuse/dep5` has been deleted. This file previously contained copyright and licensing information in Debian's copyright format, including details about API usage with SAP products, copyright notice (2022 SAP SE or affiliates), and Apache-2.0 license information.
2. A new file `REUSE.toml` has been created with similar copyright and licensing information but in a different format. It includes the package name, supplier information, download location, and the same detailed disclaimer about API usage with SAP products that was in the deleted file.
3. The new `REUSE.toml` file also contains annotations specifying that the copyright text and Apache-2.0 license apply to all files (`path = "**"`) with aggregate precedence, effectively maintaining the same licensing terms but in a different configuration format.
