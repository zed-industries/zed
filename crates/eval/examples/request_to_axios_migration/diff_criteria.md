1. The first change replaces the `request` module import with `axios` in Tunnel.js. This is accompanied by modifications to the request parameters where `path` and `json` fields are removed and replaced with `responseType: 'json'`. The request URI construction is also slightly modified to separate the base URI from the parameters.
2. The second chunk shows significant changes to the request handling logic in Tunnel.js. The callback-based `request` implementation is replaced with a promise-based `axios.get` approach. The error handling is restructured to use `.catch()` instead of checking for errors in the callback. The success case now extracts data from `res.data` instead of directly from the response body, and the status code check looks at `res.status` instead of `res.statusCode`.
3. The third chunk shows changes to package.json where the `request` dependency is removed and replaced with `axios` at version 0.17.1. The dependencies are also reordered, with `debug` and `openurl` moved up and `yargs` moved to the end of the list, though their versions remain unchanged. The devDependencies section remains untouched.
