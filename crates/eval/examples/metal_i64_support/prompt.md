I'd like to improve the configurability and usability of the text generation script for the CodeGeeX4-9B model. Please refactor the argument parsing to set more user-friendly defaults where possible, especially for generation parameters like temperature and top-p, and change fields like verbose_prompt to a more general verbose flag. Simplify the handling of optional paths like cache or weight paths, making them truly optional with fallbacks. I also want the model config to support deserialization from a JSON file instead of relying on hardcoded defaults, including support for a rope_ratio parameter with a sensible default. Lastly, please clean up the code for consistency—such as import ordering—and ensure everything aligns with these improvements without changing the overall functionality.
