We need to improve how our language model handles file attachments by making the file type definitions more modular and reusable. Currently, file-related properties are defined inline within the modelâ€™s response and stream types, which makes maintenance harder and duplicates documentation. The goal is to extract these definitions into a dedicated type that can be shared consistently across both static responses and streaming payloads. The new type should include clear documentation about media types (referencing IANA standards) and support both base64 and binary data formats without unnecessary conversions. This change should maintain backward compatibility while centralizing the file structure definition for better type safety and readability. Focus on clean separation of concerns, and ensure the extracted type is properly exported and imported where needed.
