1. The function `report_data_size` has been refactored to have a more accessible visibility by changing from `pub(super)` to `pub` in the `CommittedState` struct, making it usable outside of its previous scope.
2. The `record_tx_metrics` function has been modified to remove the previously commented-out code that invoked `report_data_size` from `committed_state`. The intention to possibly inline this functionality or refactor the metrics updates is noted.
3. A new function `update_data_size_metrics` has been introduced in the `RelationalDB` struct to simplify calling the `report_data_size` method, enhancing clarity and direct usage within the database context.
4. The `storage_monitor` function has been renamed and refactored to `metric_reporter`, which is tasked with collecting disk usage statistics and invoking `update_data_size_metrics` for database state updates.
5. Various asynchronous operations involving time intervals for disk usage measurement and reporting have been restructured for improved metric collection, reducing unnecessary operations and improving clarity.
6. Comments and TODOs are placed where further improvements, such as adding heap usage metrics, are possible, guiding future enhancements.
