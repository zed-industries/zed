1. The GitHub workflow file has been significantly updated to expand testing coverage and improve the CI process. The changes introduce a new `fail-fast: false` setting to allow all matrix combinations to complete even if some fail. The testing matrix now includes PHP 8.4 and Laravel 12.* alongside the existing versions. The configuration includes specific testbench version mappings for Laravel 12.* and removes the DBAL requirement for Laravel 11.* tests. Numerous new test combinations have been added across all Laravel versions to include PHP 8.4 testing. The dependency installation process has been restructured into separate steps - one specifically for DBAL when needed, and another for general dependencies using updated composer commands with precise version constraints.
2. The composer.json file has been updated to support the newly added Laravel 12.* version in both the main requirements and development dependencies. The testbench package now explicitly includes versions 5.* and 10.* in its supported range. For testing tools, PHPUnit 11.* has been added to the list of supported versions while maintaining backward compatibility with older versions. These changes ensure the package can be used with the latest Laravel ecosystem components while preserving compatibility with existing installations.
st file modifications primarily focus on adapting to changes in Laravel 11+ where column type handling was updated. The changes introduce version-aware assertions that check whether to expect 'string' or 'varchar' as column types based on the Laravel version being tested. A new import for the version comparison function was added to support these conditional checks. Additional safeguards were implemented, including a check for the HandlesAnnotations trait before running database migration tests, making the test suite more robust when running in different environments. The column type assertions in multiple test methods were updated to use these version-aware checks to maintain compatibility across Laravel versions.
