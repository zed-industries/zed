I need to improve our logout feature. When users sign out, they should be able to specify a return URL to redirect to afterward. Right now, signing out just takes them to a default page, but we want to support custom redirects (like back to the homepage or a login screen). The URL should be safely included in the logout request. Make sure existing logouts still work normally when no redirect is specified.

Also, note that we updated how the client initializes its session. It should now check for either a `workos-has-session` cookie or a valid refresh token (even in devMode). This ensures that sessions are refreshed appropriately even without a code in the URL. Be sure this logic is covered by the minimum tests.
