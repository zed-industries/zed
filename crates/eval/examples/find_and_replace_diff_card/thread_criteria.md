1. The first tool call should be to path search including "find_replace_file_tool.rs" in the string. (*Not* grep, for example, or reading the file based on a guess at the path.) This is because we gave the model a filename and it needs to turn that into a real path.
2. After obtaining the correct path of "zed/crates/assistant_tools/src/find_replace_file_tool.rs", it should read the contents of that path.
3. When trying to find information about the Render trait, it should *not* begin with a path search, because it doesn't yet have any information on what path the Render trait might be in.
