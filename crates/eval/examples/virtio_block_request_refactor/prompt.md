Refactor the virtio block deviceâ€™s I/O handling to eliminate generic type parameters from file engine structures, replacing them with the concrete `PendingRequest` type. Update the `AsyncFileEngine` and `FileEngine` implementations to directly handle `PendingRequest` in all operations, ensuring error types like `RequestError` propagate this request context. Rename `UserDataError`/`UserDataOk` to `RequestError`/`RequestOk` and adjust their internals to store `PendingRequest` instead of a generic `user_data`. Simplify imports (e.g., consolidate `io_uring` imports) and modify test code to initialize `PendingRequest` properly with default values where needed. Maintain all existing async/sync I/O functionality, including dirty memory tracking and request completion logic.
