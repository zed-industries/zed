1. **Field Renaming and Semantic Clarification**: The `hold` field in `Options`, `TerminalOptions`, and `PtyOptions` has been renamed to `drain_on_exit` across the codebase. This improves semantic clarity by distinguishing between two distinct behaviors: draining output before exit versus holding the terminal open after exit.
2. **Behavioral Shift in Exit Logic**: The logic previously controlled by `hold` now uses `drain_on_exit`, ensuring the child processâ€™s output is drained upon termination, but the window may still close unless explicitly held open via external means. Exit handling in `event_loop.rs` has been updated to reflect this behavioral distinction.
3. **Config and Struct Updates**: All related structs (`UiConfig`, `Window`, `WindowContext`, `EventLoop`) have been updated to reflect the new `drain_on_exit` naming. This ensures consistent naming and avoids legacy confusion.
4. **UI Window Behavior**: A new `hold` field has been added to the `Window` struct to manage whether the terminal window should remain open on exit, separating UI behavior from terminal process behavior.
5. **Exit Control Improvements**: When a user closes a window manually (`CloseRequested` event), `hold` is explicitly set to `false` to allow proper shutdown, ensuring manual control supersedes configuration-based persistence.
6. **Documentation and Changelog Updates**: The CHANGELOG entry for version `0.25.0-dev` documents the replacement of `hold` with `drain_on_exit`, providing visibility into this breaking change and its rationale (terminal holding should now be handled externally).
