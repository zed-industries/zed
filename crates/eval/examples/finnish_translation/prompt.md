I’m working on adding Finnish (fi) language support to our array method reference application, which helps users determine the right JavaScript array methods based on their needs. To achieve this, I’ll need to:

First, create the Finnish locale file containing translations for method selection options, method types (such as add, remove, find, and iterate), and primary action choices. Next, I’ll add Finnish translations to the store, covering all array methods (like splice, push, and unshift), including detailed descriptions of their behaviors, parameters, return values, and example code with outputs.

Additionally, I’ll generate a Finnish meta file with language metadata (language code, full name, and contributor info). Finally, I’ll update the main store index to integrate Finnish alongside existing languages like English, Spanish, and German.
