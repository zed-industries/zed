1. A new changeset file is created to document a patch that improves diff editing animations and enhances prompts for large file edits. An indicator showing the number of diff edits is also added next to each file path.
2. In `diff.ts`, the error message thrown when a `SEARCH` block doesn’t match content has been updated to clarify that the mismatch could be due to out-of-order blocks.
3. In `responses.ts`, the assistant response for diff mismatches now recommends limiting to 1–3 `SEARCH/REPLACE` blocks at a time for large files. It also simplifies fallback instructions for using the `write_to_file` tool.
4. The `DiffViewProvider.ts` file has been updated to replace line-by-line animations with chunk-based updates for better performance. For large diffs, a smooth scrolling animation is introduced to maintain visual context. Small diffs still scroll directly.
5. In `CodeAccordian.tsx`, a new visual indicator displays the number of `REPLACE` blocks in the code diff using a diff icon and count, providing quick insight into the volume of changes.
