Iâ€™d like to add the ability to set terminal window titles in our Bubble Tea framework. This would let applications dynamically update the title bar (e.g., to show status or app names).

Requirements:

Expose a user-friendly way to set titles (e.g., a SetWindowTitle command).
Ensure it works cross-platform with standard terminal escape codes.
Include a minimal example and docs showing usage.
Constraints:

Follow existing patterns for commands/messages.
Thread-safe rendering.
