1. Adds a new `setWindowTitle` method to the `standardRenderer` struct that sets the terminal window title using the OSC 0 escape sequence. It includes thread safety with mutex locking and uses fmt.Fprintf to send the escape sequence with the provided title.
2. Modifies the `handleMessages` method in `standardRenderer` to handle a new `setWindowTitleMsg` message type by calling the new `setWindowTitle` method. This completes the rendering-side implementation for window title updates.
3. Updates the event loop in the Program struct to properly handle `setWindowTitleMsg` messages by passing them through to the renderer without additional processing, similar to other renderer-specific messages.
4. Adds documentation to the commands tutorial README explaining how to set window titles in Bubble Tea applications. It shows examples of using `tea.SetWindowTitle()` in both Init and Update methods, and explains its usefulness for reflecting application state in the window title.
