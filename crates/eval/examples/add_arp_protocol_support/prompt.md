Add full support for the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) in the packet sniffer. This includes recognizing ARP packets during packet analysis, displaying ARP operation types in the UI, and updating data structures to track ARP-specific metadata. Integrate ARP into the protocol filtering system, update all relevant UI logic to ensure it handles ARP packets similarly to ICMP, and ensure proper test coverage for all new functionality. Update `Protocol::ALL` to include ARP and skip service detection for ARP packets, as they donâ€™t use ports. Finally, ensure the `connection_details_page` displays the ARP operation types with counts, using a `pretty_print_types` method similar to ICMP types.
