1. **Protocol Enumeration:** Ensure the `Protocol` enum includes the `ARP` variant and is integrated in `Protocol::ALL`.
2. **Packet Analysis Logic:**
   - Properly detect ARP packets within `analyze_headers` and `analyze_network_header`.
   - Appropriately extract ARP sender/target IPs based on the protocol (IPv4 or IPv6).
   - Track and store ARP operations (Request, Reply) using the `ArpType` enum.
3. **Display & User Interface:**
   - Accurately represent ARP packet types in the UI (`connection_details_page.rs`) alongside ICMP types.
   - Skip displaying service information for ARP packets in line with ICMP behavior.
4. **Data Struct Enhancements:**
   - Update `InfoAddressPortPair` to store and count ARP operation types.
   - Ensure filtering and presentation logic uses ARP data correctly.
5. **Default Behaviors:**
   - Set default `protocol` in `PacketFiltersFields` to `ARP` for consistency.
6. **Testing:**
   - Update unit tests for `Protocol::ALL` and `get_service` to account for ARP behavior.
   - Confirm that ARP protocol toggling works properly in the GUI protocol filter handling.
