Upgrade all Goose-related packages and apps from version 1.0.17 to 1.0.18 throughout the codebase. This includes updating version references in Cargo.lock, package-lock.json, and source files where applicable. In addition, streamline the addExtension logic in App.tsx by removing the outdated addExtensionToConfig references and replacing them with the new unified addExtension function. Ensure that all function dependencies and hooks reflect this updated usage. The goal is to improve maintainability and consistency across the codebase without introducing any functional changes.
