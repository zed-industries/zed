Parsing Engine,✅ CSV only,Handles quotes and escaped characters,Background parsing prevents UI blocking,,Not sure how to handle malformed csv (extra columns in non-header row)
Integration,🔄 "POC. Need feedback",Workspace action + file type detection,Standard Zed extension pattern,Existing codebase patterns,Seeking team feedback on approach
Ultimate goal: DB client,Not started,"Eventually want to write generic ""table-data viewer"" to use with database client in the future",,JetBrains IDEs,
Ordering by column,✅ Completed
Line numbering,✅ Completed,Both src line numbers and row numbers work
