# Zed Server

This crate is what we run at https://collab.zed.dev.

It contains our back-end logic for collaboration, to which we connect from the Zed client via a websocket after authenticating via https://zed.dev, which is a separate repo running on Vercel.

# Local Development

 Detailed instructions on getting started are [here](https://zed.dev/docs/local-collaboration).

# Deployment

We run two instances of collab:

* Staging (https://staging-collab.zed.dev)
* Production (https://collab.zed.dev)

Both of these run on the Kubernetes cluster hosted in Digital Ocean.

Deployment is triggered by pushing to the `collab-staging` (or `collab-production`) tag in Github. The best way to do this is:

* `./script/deploy-collab staging`
* `./script/deploy-collab production`

You can tell what is currently deployed with `./script/what-is-deployed`.

# Database Migrations

To create a new migration:

```
./script/sqlx migrate add <name>
```

Migrations are run automatically on service start, so run `foreman start` again. The service will crash if the migrations fail.

When you create a new migration, you also need to update the [SQLite schema](./migrations.sqlite/20221109000000_test_schema.sql) that is used for testing.
