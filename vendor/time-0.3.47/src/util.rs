/// # Safety
///
/// This is a system call with specific requirements. The following is from POSIX's description of
/// `tzset`:
///
/// > If a thread accesses `tzname`, `daylight`, or `timezone` directly while another thread is in a
/// > call to `tzset()`, or to any function that is required or allowed to set timezone information
/// > as if by calling `tzset()`, the behavior is undefined.
///
/// Effectively, this translates to the requirement that at least one of the following must be true:
///
/// - The operating system provides a thread-safe environment.
/// - The process is single-threaded.
/// - The process is multi-threaded **and** no other thread is mutating the environment in any way
///   at the same time a call to a method that obtains the local UTC offset. This includes adding,
///   removing, or modifying an environment variable.
///
/// ## Soundness is global
///
/// You must not only verify this safety conditions for your code, but for **all** code that will be
/// included in the final binary. Notably, it applies to both direct and transitive dependencies and
/// to both Rust and non-Rust code. **For this reason it is not possible for a library to soundly
/// call this method.**
///
/// ## Forward compatibility
///
/// This currently only does anything on Unix-like systems. On other systems, it is a no-op. This
/// may change in the future if necessary, expanding the safety requirements. It is expected that,
/// at a minimum, calling this method when the process is single-threaded will remain sound.
