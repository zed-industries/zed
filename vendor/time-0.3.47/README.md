## Minimum Rust version policy

`time` is guaranteed to compile with the latest stable release of Rust in addition to the two prior
minor releases. For example, if the latest stable Rust release is 1.70, then `time` is guaranteed to
compile with Rust 1.68, 1.69, and 1.70.

The minimum supported Rust version may be increased to one of the aforementioned versions if doing
so provides the end user a benefit. However, the minimum supported Rust version may also be bumped
to a version four minor releases prior to the most recent stable release if doing so improves code
quality or maintainability.

For interoperability with third-party crates, it is guaranteed that there exists a version of that
crate that supports the minimum supported Rust version of `time`. This does not mean that the latest
version of the third-party crate supports the minimum supported Rust version of `time`.
