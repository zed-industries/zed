//! Timer state structures.
//!
//! This module contains the heart of the intrusive timer implementation, and as
//! such the structures inside are full of tricky concurrency and unsafe code.
//!
//! # Ground rules
//!
//! The heart of the timer implementation here is the [`TimerShared`] structure,
//! shared between the [`TimerEntry`] and the driver. Generally, we permit access
//! to [`TimerShared`] ONLY via either 1) a mutable reference to [`TimerEntry`] or
//! 2) a held driver lock.
//!
//! It follows from this that any changes made while holding BOTH 1 and 2 will
//! be reliably visible, regardless of ordering. This is because of the `acq/rel`
//! fences on the driver lock ensuring ordering with 2, and rust mutable
//! reference rules for 1 (a mutable reference to an object can't be passed
//! between threads without an `acq/rel` barrier, and same-thread we have local
//! happens-before ordering).
//!
//! # State field
//!
//! Each timer has a state field associated with it. This field contains either
//! the current scheduled time, or a special flag value indicating its state.
//! This state can either indicate that the timer is on the 'pending' queue (and
//! thus will be fired with an `Ok(())` result soon) or that it has already been
//! fired/deregistered.
//!
//! This single state field allows for code that is firing the timer to
//! synchronize with any racing `reset` calls reliably.
//!
//! # Registered vs true timeouts
//!
//! To allow for the use case of a timeout that is periodically reset before
//! expiration to be as lightweight as possible, we support optimistically
//! lock-free timer resets, in the case where a timer is rescheduled to a later
//! point than it was originally scheduled for.
//!
//! This is accomplished by lazily rescheduling timers. That is, we update the
//! state field with the true expiration of the timer from the holder of
//! the [`TimerEntry`]. When the driver services timers (ie, whenever it's
//! walking lists of timers), it checks this "true when" value, and reschedules
//! based on it.
//!
//! We do, however, also need to track what the expiration time was when we
//! originally registered the timer; this is used to locate the right linked
//! list when the timer is being cancelled.
//! This is referred to as the `registered_when` internally.
//!
//! There is of course a race condition between timer reset and timer
//! expiration. If the driver fails to observe the updated expiration time, it
//! could trigger expiration of the timer too early. However, because
//! [`mark_pending`][mark_pending] performs a compare-and-swap, it will identify this race and
//! refuse to mark the timer as pending.
//!
