/// The Tokio runtime.
///
/// The runtime provides an I/O driver, task scheduler, [timer], and
/// blocking pool, necessary for running asynchronous tasks.
///
/// Instances of `Runtime` can be created using [`new`], or [`Builder`].
/// However, most users will use the [`#[tokio::main]`][main] annotation on
/// their entry point instead.
///
/// See [module level][mod] documentation for more details.
///
/// # Shutdown
///
/// Shutting down the runtime is done by dropping the value, or calling
/// [`shutdown_background`] or [`shutdown_timeout`].
///
/// Tasks spawned through [`Runtime::spawn`] keep running until they yield.
/// Then they are dropped. They are not *guaranteed* to run to completion, but
/// *might* do so if they do not yield until completion.
///
/// Blocking functions spawned through [`Runtime::spawn_blocking`] keep running
/// until they return.
///
/// The thread initiating the shutdown blocks until all spawned work has been
/// stopped. This can take an indefinite amount of time. The `Drop`
/// implementation waits forever for this.
///
/// The [`shutdown_background`] and [`shutdown_timeout`] methods can be used if
/// waiting forever is undesired. When the timeout is reached, spawned work that
/// did not stop in time and threads running it are leaked. The work continues
/// to run until one of the stopping conditions is fulfilled, but the thread
/// initiating the shutdown is unblocked.
///
/// Once the runtime has been dropped, any outstanding I/O resources bound to
/// it will no longer function. Calling any method on them will result in an
/// error.
///
/// # Sharing
///
/// There are several ways to establish shared access to a Tokio runtime:
///
///  * Using an <code>[Arc]\<Runtime></code>.
///  * Using a [`Handle`].
///  * Entering the runtime context.
///
/// Using an <code>[Arc]\<Runtime></code> or [`Handle`] allows you to do various
/// things with the runtime such as spawning new tasks or entering the runtime
/// context. Both types can be cloned to create a new handle that allows access
/// to the same runtime. By passing clones into different tasks or threads, you
/// will be able to access the runtime from those tasks or threads.
///
/// The difference between <code>[Arc]\<Runtime></code> and [`Handle`] is that
/// an <code>[Arc]\<Runtime></code> will prevent the runtime from shutting down,
/// whereas a [`Handle`] does not prevent that. This is because shutdown of the
/// runtime happens when the destructor of the `Runtime` object runs.
///
/// Calls to [`shutdown_background`] and [`shutdown_timeout`] require exclusive
/// ownership of the `Runtime` type. When using an <code>[Arc]\<Runtime></code>,
/// this can be achieved via [`Arc::try_unwrap`] when only one strong count
/// reference is left over.
///
/// The runtime context is entered using the [`Runtime::enter`] or
/// [`Handle::enter`] methods, which use a thread-local variable to store the
/// current runtime. Whenever you are inside the runtime context, methods such
/// as [`tokio::spawn`] will use the runtime whose context you are inside.
