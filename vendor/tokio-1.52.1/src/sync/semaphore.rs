/// Counting semaphore performing asynchronous permit acquisition.
///
/// A semaphore maintains a set of permits. Permits are used to synchronize
/// access to a shared resource. A semaphore differs from a mutex in that it
/// can allow more than one concurrent caller to access the shared resource at a
/// time.
///
/// When `acquire` is called and the semaphore has remaining permits, the
/// function immediately returns a permit. However, if no remaining permits are
/// available, `acquire` (asynchronously) waits until an outstanding permit is
/// dropped. At this point, the freed permit is assigned to the caller.
///
/// This `Semaphore` is fair, which means that permits are given out in the order
/// they were requested. This fairness is also applied when `acquire_many` gets
/// involved, so if a call to `acquire_many` at the front of the queue requests
/// more permits than currently available, this can prevent a call to `acquire`
/// from completing, even if the semaphore has enough permits complete the call
/// to `acquire`.
///
/// To use the `Semaphore` in a poll function, you can use the [`PollSemaphore`]
/// utility.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Basic usage:
///
/// ```
/// use tokio::sync::{Semaphore, TryAcquireError};
///
/// # #[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]
/// # async fn main() {
/// let semaphore = Semaphore::new(3);
///
/// let a_permit = semaphore.acquire().await.unwrap();
/// let two_permits = semaphore.acquire_many(2).await.unwrap();
///
/// assert_eq!(semaphore.available_permits(), 0);
///
/// let permit_attempt = semaphore.try_acquire();
/// assert_eq!(permit_attempt.err(), Some(TryAcquireError::NoPermits));
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ## Limit the number of simultaneously opened files in your program
///
/// Most operating systems have limits on the number of open file
/// handles. Even in systems without explicit limits, resource constraints
/// implicitly set an upper bound on the number of open files. If your
/// program attempts to open a large number of files and exceeds this
/// limit, it will result in an error.
///
/// This example uses a Semaphore with 100 permits. By acquiring a permit from
/// the Semaphore before accessing a file, you ensure that your program opens
/// no more than 100 files at a time. When trying to open the 101st
/// file, the program will wait until a permit becomes available before
/// proceeding to open another file.
/// ```
/// # #[cfg(not(target_family = "wasm"))]
/// # {
/// use std::io::Result;
/// use tokio::fs::File;
/// use tokio::sync::Semaphore;
/// use tokio::io::AsyncWriteExt;
///
/// static PERMITS: Semaphore = Semaphore::const_new(100);
///
/// async fn write_to_file(message: &[u8]) -> Result<()> {
///     let _permit = PERMITS.acquire().await.unwrap();
///     let mut buffer = File::create("example.txt").await?;
///     buffer.write_all(message).await?;
///     Ok(()) // Permit goes out of scope here, and is available again for acquisition
/// }
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ## Limit the number of outgoing requests being sent at the same time
///
/// In some scenarios, it might be required to limit the number of outgoing
/// requests being sent in parallel. This could be due to limits of a consumed
/// API or the network resources of the system the application is running on.
///
/// This example uses an `Arc<Semaphore>` with 10 permits. Each task spawned is
/// given a reference to the semaphore by cloning the `Arc<Semaphore>`. Before
/// a task sends a request, it must acquire a permit from the semaphore by
/// calling [`Semaphore::acquire`]. This ensures that at most 10 requests are
/// sent in parallel at any given time. After a task has sent a request, it
/// drops the permit to allow other tasks to send requests.
///
/// ```
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// use tokio::sync::Semaphore;
///
/// # #[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]
/// # async fn main() {
/// // Define maximum number of parallel requests.
/// let semaphore = Arc::new(Semaphore::new(5));
/// // Spawn many tasks that will send requests.
/// let mut jhs = Vec::new();
/// for task_id in 0..50 {
///     let semaphore = semaphore.clone();
///     let jh = tokio::spawn(async move {
///         // Acquire permit before sending request.
///         let _permit = semaphore.acquire().await.unwrap();
///         // Send the request.
///         let response = send_request(task_id).await;
///         // Drop the permit after the request has been sent.
///         drop(_permit);
///         // Handle response.
///         // ...
///
///         response
///     });
///     jhs.push(jh);
/// }
/// // Collect responses from tasks.
/// let mut responses = Vec::new();
/// for jh in jhs {
///     let response = jh.await.unwrap();
///     responses.push(response);
/// }
/// // Process responses.
/// // ...
/// # }
/// # async fn send_request(task_id: usize) {
/// #     // Send request.
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ## Limit the number of incoming requests being handled at the same time
///
/// Similar to limiting the number of simultaneously opened files, network handles
/// are a limited resource. Allowing an unbounded amount of requests to be processed
/// could result in a denial-of-service, among many other issues.
///
/// This example uses an `Arc<Semaphore>` instead of a global variable.
/// To limit the number of requests that can be processed at the time,
/// we acquire a permit for each task before spawning it. Once acquired,
/// a new task is spawned; and once finished, the permit is dropped inside
/// of the task to allow others to spawn. Permits must be acquired via
/// [`Semaphore::acquire_owned`] to be movable across the task boundary.
/// (Since our semaphore is not a global variable — if it was, then `acquire` would be enough.)
///

/// ## Prevent tests from running in parallel
///
/// By default, Rust runs tests in the same file in parallel. However, in some
/// cases, running two tests in parallel may lead to problems. For example, this
/// can happen when tests use the same database.
///
/// Consider the following scenario:
/// 1. `test_insert`: Inserts a key-value pair into the database, then retrieves
///    the value using the same key to verify the insertion.
/// 2. `test_update`: Inserts a key, then updates the key to a new value and
///    verifies that the value has been accurately updated.
/// 3. `test_others`: A third test that doesn't modify the database state. It
///    can run in parallel with the other tests.
///
/// In this example, `test_insert` and `test_update` need to run in sequence to
/// work, but it doesn't matter which test runs first. We can leverage a
/// semaphore with a single permit to address this challenge.
///

/// ## Rate limiting using a token bucket
///
/// This example showcases the [`add_permits`] and [`SemaphorePermit::forget`] methods.
///
/// Many applications and systems have constraints on the rate at which certain
/// operations should occur. Exceeding this rate can result in suboptimal
/// performance or even errors.
///
/// This example implements rate limiting using a [token bucket]. A token bucket is a form of rate
/// limiting that doesn't kick in immediately, to allow for short bursts of incoming requests that
/// arrive at the same time.
///
/// With a token bucket, each incoming request consumes a token, and the tokens are refilled at a
/// certain rate that defines the rate limit. When a burst of requests arrives, tokens are
/// immediately given out until the bucket is empty. Once the bucket is empty, requests will have to
/// wait for new tokens to be added.
///
/// Unlike the example that limits how many requests can be handled at the same time, we do not add
/// tokens back when we finish handling a request. Instead, tokens are added only by a timer task.
///
/// Note that this implementation is suboptimal when the duration is small, because it consumes a
/// lot of cpu constantly looping and sleeping.
