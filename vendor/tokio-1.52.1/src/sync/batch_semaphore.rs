#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "sync"), allow(unreachable_pub, dead_code))]
//! # Implementation Details.
//!
//! The semaphore is implemented using an intrusive linked list of waiters. An
//! atomic counter tracks the number of available permits. If the semaphore does
//! not contain the required number of permits, the task attempting to acquire
//! permits places its waker at the end of a queue. When new permits are made
//! available (such as by releasing an initial acquisition), they are assigned
//! to the task at the front of the queue, waking that task if its requested
//! number of permits is met.
//!
//! Because waiters are enqueued at the back of the linked list and dequeued
//! from the front, the semaphore is fair. Tasks trying to acquire large numbers
//! of permits at a time will always be woken eventually, even if many other
//! tasks are acquiring smaller numbers of permits. This means that in a
//! use-case like tokio's read-write lock, writers will not be starved by
//! readers.
