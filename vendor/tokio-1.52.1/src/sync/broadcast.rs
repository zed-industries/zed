//! A multi-producer, multi-consumer broadcast queue. Each sent value is seen by
//! all consumers.
//!
//! A [`Sender`] is used to broadcast values to **all** connected [`Receiver`]
//! values. [`Sender`] handles are clone-able, allowing concurrent send and
//! receive actions. [`Sender`] and [`Receiver`] are both `Send` and `Sync` as
//! long as `T` is `Send`.
//!
//! When a value is sent, **all** [`Receiver`] handles are notified and will
//! receive the value. The value is stored once inside the channel and cloned on
//! demand for each receiver. Once all receivers have received a clone of the
//! value, the value is released from the channel.
//!
//! A channel is created by calling [`channel`], specifying the maximum number
//! of messages the channel can retain at any given time.
//!
//! New [`Receiver`] handles are created by calling [`Sender::subscribe`]. The
//! returned [`Receiver`] will receive values sent **after** the call to
//! `subscribe`.
//!
//! This channel is also suitable for the single-producer multi-consumer
//! use-case, where a single sender broadcasts values to many receivers.
//!
//! ## Lagging
//!
//! As sent messages must be retained until **all** [`Receiver`] handles receive
//! a clone, broadcast channels are susceptible to the "slow receiver" problem.
//! In this case, all but one receiver are able to receive values at the rate
//! they are sent. Because one receiver is stalled, the channel starts to fill
//! up.
//!
//! This broadcast channel implementation handles this case by setting a hard
//! upper bound on the number of values the channel may retain at any given
//! time. This upper bound is passed to the [`channel`] function as an argument.
//!
//! If a value is sent when the channel is at capacity, the oldest value
//! currently held by the channel is released. This frees up space for the new
//! value. Any receiver that has not yet seen the released value will return
//! [`RecvError::Lagged`] the next time [`recv`] is called.
//!
//! Once [`RecvError::Lagged`] is returned, the lagging receiver's position is
//! updated to the oldest value contained by the channel. The next call to
//! [`recv`] will return this value.
//!
//! This behavior enables a receiver to detect when it has lagged so far behind
//! that data has been dropped. The caller may decide how to respond to this:
//! either by aborting its task or by tolerating lost messages and resuming
//! consumption of the channel.
//!
//! ## Closing
//!
//! When **all** [`Sender`] handles have been dropped, no new values may be
//! sent. At this point, the channel is "closed". Once a receiver has received
//! all values retained by the channel, the next call to [`recv`] will return
//! with [`RecvError::Closed`].
//!
//! When a [`Receiver`] handle is dropped, any messages not read by the receiver
//! will be marked as read. If this receiver was the only one not to have read
//! that message, the message will be dropped at this point.
