/// Reads bytes from a source.
///
/// This trait is analogous to the [`std::io::Read`] trait, but integrates with
/// the asynchronous task system. In particular, the [`poll_read`] method,
/// unlike [`Read::read`], will automatically queue the current task for wakeup
/// and return if data is not yet available, rather than blocking the calling
/// thread.
///
/// Specifically, this means that the `poll_read` function will return one of
/// the following:
///
/// * `Poll::Ready(Ok(()))` means that data was immediately read and placed into
///   the output buffer. The amount of data read can be determined by the
///   increase in the length of the slice returned by `ReadBuf::filled`. If the
///   difference is 0, either EOF has been reached, or the output buffer had zero
///   capacity (i.e. `buf.remaining()` == 0).
///
/// * `Poll::Pending` means that no data was read into the buffer
///   provided. The I/O object is not currently readable but may become readable
///   in the future. Most importantly, **the current future's task is scheduled
///   to get unparked when the object is readable**. This means that like
///   `Future::poll` you'll receive a notification when the I/O object is
///   readable again.
///
/// * `Poll::Ready(Err(e))` for other errors are standard I/O errors coming from the
///   underlying object.
///
/// This trait importantly means that the `read` method only works in the
/// context of a future's task. The object may panic if used outside of a task.
///
/// Utilities for working with `AsyncRead` values are provided by
/// [`AsyncReadExt`].
///

    /// On success, returns `Poll::Ready(Ok(()))` and places data in the
    /// unfilled portion of `buf`. If no data was read (`buf.filled().len()` is
    /// unchanged), it implies that EOF has been reached, or the output buffer
    /// had zero capacity (i.e. `buf.remaining()` == 0).
    ///
    /// If no data is available for reading, the method returns `Poll::Pending`
    /// and arranges for the current task (via `cx.waker()`) to receive a
    /// notification when the object becomes readable or is closed.
