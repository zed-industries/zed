- Use Waker::noop() to avoid some unsafe code. (#103)

# Version 3.4.1

- Fix typos in docs. (#89)

# Version 3.4.0

- Port to `event-listener` v5.0.0. (#74)

# Version 3.3.0

- Add a `forget()` method for semaphore guards. (#73)

# Version 3.2.0

- Add missing methods for blocking on locking with types wrapped in `Arc` (#71).

# Version 3.1.2

- Bump `event-listener` to version v4.0.0. (#69)

# Version 3.1.1

- Add a note to the documentation comparing this crate against `libstd`'s locks. (#58)

# Version 3.1.0

- Add a `Default` implementation for `OnceCell` (#63).

# Version 3.0.0

- **Breaking:** Add an enabled-by-default `std` feature that allows using this crate without the standard library. (#43)
- Support blocking and non-blocking operations on the same locks. (#56)
- Switch to a more efficient event notification mechanism. (#43)

# Version 2.8.0

- Fix a bug where the `SemaphoreGuard::acquire_arc` future would busy wait under certain conditions (#42).
- Add a `Semaphore::add_permits()` function to increase the number of available permits on the semaphore (#44).
- Make `RwLockReadGuard` covariant over its lifetime (#45)
- Add `RwLockReadGuardArc`, `RwLockWriteGuardArc`, and other reference counted guards for the `RwLock` type (#47).
- Loosen the `Send`/`Sync` bounds on certain future types (#48).
- Fix UB caused by the `MutexGuardArc::source` function allowing the user to drop an object in a different thread than the one it was acquired in (#50). This is a breaking change, but in the name of soundness. Therefore it doesn't break any valid behavior.
