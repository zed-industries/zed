Async synchronization primitives.

This crate provides the following primitives:

* `Barrier` - enables tasks to synchronize all together at the same time.
* `Mutex` - a mutual exclusion lock.
* `RwLock` - a reader-writer lock, allowing any number of readers or a single writer.
* `Semaphore` - limits the number of concurrent operations.
