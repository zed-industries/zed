/// A trait for reading references to [`Pod`] types from a block of data.
///
/// This allows parsers to handle both of these cases:
/// - the block of data exists in memory, and it is desirable
///   to use references to this block instead of copying it,
/// - the block of data exists in storage, and it is desirable
///   to read on demand to minimize I/O and memory usage.
///
/// A block of data typically exists in memory as a result of using a memory
/// mapped file, and the crate was written with this use case in mind.
/// Reading the entire file into a `Vec` is also possible, but it often uses
/// more I/O and memory.
/// Both of these are handled by the `ReadRef` implementation for `&[u8]`.
///
/// For the second use case, the `ReadRef` trait is implemented for
/// [`&ReadCache`](super::ReadCache). This is useful for environments where
/// memory mapped files are not available or not suitable, such as WebAssembly.
/// This differs from reading into a `Vec` in that it only reads the portions
/// of the file that are needed for parsing.
///
/// The methods accept `self` by value because `Self` is expected to behave
/// similar to a reference: it may be a reference with a lifetime of `'a`,
/// or it may be a wrapper of a reference.
///
/// The `Clone` and `Copy` bounds are for convenience, and since `Self` is
/// expected to be similar to a reference, these are easily satisfied.
///
/// Object file parsers typically use offsets to locate the structures
/// in the block, and will most commonly use the `*_at` methods to
/// read a structure at a known offset.
///
/// Occasionally file parsers will need to treat the block as a stream,
/// and so convenience methods are provided that update an offset with
/// the size that was read.
//
// An alternative would be for methods to accept `&mut self` and use a
// `seek` method instead of the `offset` parameters, but this is less
// convenient for implementers.
