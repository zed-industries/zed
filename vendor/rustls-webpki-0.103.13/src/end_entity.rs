/// An end-entity certificate.
///
/// Server certificate processing in a TLS connection consists of several
/// steps. All of these steps are necessary:
///
/// * [`EndEntityCert::verify_for_usage()`]: Verify that the peer's certificate
///   is valid for the current usage scenario. For server authentication, use
///   [`crate::KeyUsage::server_auth()`].
/// * [`EndEntityCert::verify_is_valid_for_subject_name()`]: Verify that the server's
///   certificate is valid for the host or IP address that is being connected to.
/// * [`EndEntityCert::verify_signature()`]: Verify that the signature of server's
///   `ServerKeyExchange` message is valid for the server's certificate.
///
/// Client certificate processing in a TLS connection consists of analogous
/// steps. All of these steps are necessary:
///
/// * [`EndEntityCert::verify_for_usage()`]: Verify that the peer's certificate
///   is valid for the current usage scenario. For client authentication, use
///   [`crate::KeyUsage::client_auth()`].
/// * [`EndEntityCert::verify_signature()`]: Verify that the signature of client's
///   `CertificateVerify` message is valid using the public key from the
///   client's certificate.
///
/// Although it would be less error-prone to combine all these steps into a
/// single function call, some significant optimizations are possible if the
/// three steps are processed separately (in parallel). It does not matter much
/// which order the steps are done in, but **all of these steps must completed
/// before application data is sent and before received application data is
/// processed**. The [`TryFrom`] conversion from `&CertificateDer<'_>` is an
/// inexpensive operation and is deterministic, so if these tasks are done in
/// multiple threads, it is probably best to just create multiple [`EndEntityCert`]
/// instances for the same DER-encoded ASN.1 certificate bytes.
