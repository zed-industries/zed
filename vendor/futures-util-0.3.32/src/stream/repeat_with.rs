/// Creates a new stream that repeats elements of type `A` endlessly by

///
/// Infinite stream like `repeat_with()` are often used with adapters like
/// [`stream.take()`](crate::stream::StreamExt::take), in order to make them finite.
///
/// If the element type of the stream you need implements [`Clone`], and
/// it is OK to keep the source element in memory, you should instead use
/// the [`stream::repeat()`](crate::stream::repeat) function.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Basic usage:
///
/// ```
/// # futures::executor::block_on(async {
/// use futures::stream::{self, StreamExt};
///
/// // let's assume we have some value of a type that is not `Clone`
/// // or which don't want to have in memory just yet because it is expensive:
/// #[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]
/// struct Expensive;
///
/// // a particular value forever:
/// let mut things = stream::repeat_with(|| Expensive);
///
/// assert_eq!(Some(Expensive), things.next().await);
/// assert_eq!(Some(Expensive), things.next().await);
/// assert_eq!(Some(Expensive), things.next().await);
/// # });
/// ```
///
/// Using mutation and going finite:
///
/// ```rust
/// # futures::executor::block_on(async {
/// use futures::stream::{self, StreamExt};
///
/// // From the zeroth to the third power of two:
/// let mut curr = 1;
/// let mut pow2 = stream::repeat_with(|| { let tmp = curr; curr *= 2; tmp })
///                     .take(4);
///
/// assert_eq!(Some(1), pow2.next().await);
/// assert_eq!(Some(2), pow2.next().await);
/// assert_eq!(Some(4), pow2.next().await);
/// assert_eq!(Some(8), pow2.next().await);
///
/// // ... and now we're done
/// assert_eq!(None, pow2.next().await);
/// # });
/// ```
