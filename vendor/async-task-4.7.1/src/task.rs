/// A [`Task`] can be awaited to retrieve the output of its future.
///
/// Dropping a [`Task`] cancels it, which means its future won't be polled again. To drop the

/// task gracefully and wait until it is fully destroyed, use the [`cancel()`][Task::cancel()]
/// method.
///
/// Note that canceling a task actually wakes it and reschedules one last time. Then, the executor
/// can destroy the task by simply dropping its [`Runnable`][`super::Runnable`] or by invoking
/// [`run()`][`super::Runnable::run()`].
