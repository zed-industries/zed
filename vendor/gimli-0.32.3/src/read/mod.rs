//!
//! ## Example Usage
//!
//! Print out all of the functions in the debuggee program:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # fn example() -> Result<(), gimli::Error> {
//! # type R = gimli::EndianSlice<'static, gimli::LittleEndian>;
//! # let get_file_section_reader = |name| -> Result<R, gimli::Error> { unimplemented!() };
//! # let get_sup_file_section_reader = |name| -> Result<R, gimli::Error> { unimplemented!() };
//! // Read the DWARF sections with whatever object loader you're using.
//! // These closures should return a `Reader` instance (e.g. `EndianSlice`).
//! let loader = |section: gimli::SectionId| { get_file_section_reader(section.name()) };
//! let sup_loader = |section: gimli::SectionId| { get_sup_file_section_reader(section.name()) };
//! let mut dwarf = gimli::Dwarf::load(loader)?;
//! dwarf.load_sup(sup_loader)?;
//!
//! // Iterate over all compilation units.
//! let mut iter = dwarf.units();
//! while let Some(header) = iter.next()? {
//!     // Parse the abbreviations and other information for this compilation unit.
//!     let unit = dwarf.unit(header)?;
//!
//!     // Iterate over all of this compilation unit's entries.
//!     let mut entries = unit.entries();
//!     while let Some((_, entry)) = entries.next_dfs()? {
//!         // If we find an entry for a function, print it.
//!         if entry.tag() == gimli::DW_TAG_subprogram {
//!             println!("Found a function: {:?}", entry);
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! # unreachable!()
//! # }
//! ```

//!
//!   * [`dwarf-validate`](https://github.com/gimli-rs/gimli/blob/master/crates/examples/src/bin/dwarf-validate.rs),
//!     a program to validate the integrity of some DWARF and its references
//!     between sections and compilation units.
//!
//! ## API Structure
//!
//! * Basic familiarity with DWARF is assumed.
//!
//! * The [`Dwarf`](./struct.Dwarf.html) type contains the commonly used DWARF
//!   sections. It has methods that simplify access to debugging data that spans
//!   multiple sections. Use of this type is optional, but recommended.
//!
//! * The [`DwarfPackage`](./struct.Dwarf.html) type contains the DWARF
//!   package (DWP) sections. It has methods to find a DWARF object (DWO)
//!   within the package.
//!
//! * Each section gets its own type. Consider these types the entry points to
//!   the library:
//!
//!   * [`DebugAbbrev`](./struct.DebugAbbrev.html): The `.debug_abbrev` section.
//!
//!   * [`DebugAddr`](./struct.DebugAddr.html): The `.debug_addr` section.
//!
//!   * [`DebugAranges`](./struct.DebugAranges.html): The `.debug_aranges`
//!     section.
//!
//!   * [`DebugFrame`](./struct.DebugFrame.html): The `.debug_frame` section.
//!
//!   * [`DebugInfo`](./struct.DebugInfo.html): The `.debug_info` section.
//!
//!   * [`DebugLine`](./struct.DebugLine.html): The `.debug_line` section.
//!
//!   * [`DebugLineStr`](./struct.DebugLineStr.html): The `.debug_line_str` section.
//!
//!   * [`DebugLoc`](./struct.DebugLoc.html): The `.debug_loc` section.
//!
//!   * [`DebugLocLists`](./struct.DebugLocLists.html): The `.debug_loclists` section.
//!
//!   * [`DebugPubNames`](./struct.DebugPubNames.html): The `.debug_pubnames`
//!     section.
//!
//!   * [`DebugPubTypes`](./struct.DebugPubTypes.html): The `.debug_pubtypes`
//!     section.
//!
//!   * [`DebugRanges`](./struct.DebugRanges.html): The `.debug_ranges` section.
//!
//!   * [`DebugRngLists`](./struct.DebugRngLists.html): The `.debug_rnglists` section.
//!
//!   * [`DebugStr`](./struct.DebugStr.html): The `.debug_str` section.
//!
//!   * [`DebugStrOffsets`](./struct.DebugStrOffsets.html): The `.debug_str_offsets` section.
//!
//!   * [`DebugTypes`](./struct.DebugTypes.html): The `.debug_types` section.
//!
//!   * [`DebugCuIndex`](./struct.DebugCuIndex.html): The `.debug_cu_index` section.
//!
//!   * [`DebugTuIndex`](./struct.DebugTuIndex.html): The `.debug_tu_index` section.
//!
//!   * [`EhFrame`](./struct.EhFrame.html): The `.eh_frame` section.
//!
//!   * [`EhFrameHdr`](./struct.EhFrameHdr.html): The `.eh_frame_hdr` section.
//!
//! * Each section type exposes methods for accessing the debugging data encoded
//!   in that section. For example, the [`DebugInfo`](./struct.DebugInfo.html)
//!   struct has the [`units`](./struct.DebugInfo.html#method.units) method for
//!   iterating over the compilation units defined within it.
//!
//! * Offsets into a section are strongly typed: an offset into `.debug_info` is
//!   the [`DebugInfoOffset`](./struct.DebugInfoOffset.html) type. It cannot be
//!   used to index into the [`DebugLine`](./struct.DebugLine.html) type because
//!   `DebugLine` represents the `.debug_line` section. There are similar types
//!   for offsets relative to a compilation unit rather than a section.
//!
//! ## Using with `FallibleIterator`
//!
//! The standard library's `Iterator` trait and related APIs do not play well
//! with iterators where the `next` operation is fallible. One can make the
//! `Iterator`'s associated `Item` type be a `Result<T, E>`, however the
//! provided methods cannot gracefully handle the case when an `Err` is
//! returned.
//!
//! This situation led to the
//! [`fallible-iterator`](https://crates.io/crates/fallible-iterator) crate's
//! existence. You can read more of the rationale for its existence in its
//! docs. The crate provides the helpers you have come to expect (eg `map`,
//! `filter`, etc) for iterators that can fail.
//!
//! `gimli`'s many lazy parsing iterators are a perfect match for the
//! `fallible-iterator` crate's `FallibleIterator` trait because parsing is not
//! done eagerly. Parse errors later in the input might only be discovered after
//! having iterated through many items.
//!
//! To use `gimli` iterators with `FallibleIterator`, import the crate and trait
//! into your code:
//!
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(feature = "fallible-iterator")]
//! # fn foo() {
//! // Use the `FallibleIterator` trait so its methods are in scope!
//! use fallible_iterator::FallibleIterator;
//! use gimli::{DebugAranges, EndianSlice, LittleEndian};
//!
//! fn find_sum_of_address_range_lengths(aranges: DebugAranges<EndianSlice<LittleEndian>>)
//!     -> gimli::Result<u64>
//! {
//!     // `DebugAranges::headers` returns a `FallibleIterator`!
//!     aranges.headers()
//!         // `flat_map` is provided by `FallibleIterator`!
//!         .flat_map(|header| Ok(header.entries()))
//!         // `map` is provided by `FallibleIterator`!
//!         .map(|arange| Ok(arange.length()))
//!         // `fold` is provided by `FallibleIterator`!
//!         .fold(0, |sum, len| Ok(sum + len))
//! }
//! # }
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
