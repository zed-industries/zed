# Changelog

## v0.14.4 (March 9, 2023)

- Add support for child diagnostics when `diagnostics` feature enabled [#224](https://github.com/TedDriggs/darling/issues/224)

## v0.14.3 (February 3, 2023)

- Re-export `syn` from `darling` to avoid requiring that consuming crates have a `syn` dependency.
- Change `<SpannedValue<T> as FromMeta>` impl to more precisely capture the _value_ span, as opposed to the span of the entire item.
- Add `darling::util::{AsShape, Shape, ShapeSet}` to improve "shape" validation for structs and variants. [#222](https://github.com/TedDriggs/issues/222)

## v0.14.2 (October 26, 2022)

- Derived impls of `FromMeta` will now error on literals, rather than silently ignoring them. [#193](https://github.com/TedDriggs/darling/pull/193)
- Don't include property paths in compile errors when spans are available. [#203](https://github.com/TedDriggs/darling/pull/203)

## v0.14.1 (April 28, 2022)

- Fix a bug where using a trait that accepts `#[darling(attributes(...))]` without specifying any attributes would emit code that did not compile. [#183](https://github.com/TedDriggs/darling/issues/183)
- Impl `Clone` for `darling::Error` [#184](https://github.com/TedDriggs/darling/pull/184)
- Impl `From<darling::Error> for syn::Error` [#184](https://github.com/TedDriggs/darling/pull/184)
- Add `Error::span` and `Error::explicit_span` methods [#184](https://github.com/TedDriggs/darling/pull/184)

## v0.14.0 (April 13, 2022)

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Remove many trait impls from `util::Flag`. 
  This type had a number of deref and operator impls that made it usable as sort-of-a-boolean.
  Real-world usage showed this type is more useful if it's able to carry a span for good errors,
  and that most of those impls were unnecessary. [#179](https://github.com/TedDriggs/darling/pull/179)
- Remove need for `#[darling(default)]` on `Option<T>` and `Flag` fields [#161](https://github.com/TedDriggs/darling/issues/161)
- Improve validation of enum shapes [#178](https://github.com/TedDriggs/darling/pull/178)
- Bump `proc-macro2` dependency to 1.0.37 [#180](https://github.com/TedDriggs/darling/pull/180)
- Bump `quote` dependency to 1.0.18 [#180](https://github.com/TedDriggs/darling/pull/180)
- Bump `syn` dependency to 1.0.91 [#180](https://github.com/TedDriggs/darling/pull/180)

- POSSIBLY BREAKING: Derived impls of `FromDeriveInput`, `FromField`, `FromVariant`, and `FromTypeParam` will now error when encountering an attribute `darling` has been asked to parse that isn't a supported shape.
