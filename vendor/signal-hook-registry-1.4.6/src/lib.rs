//! Backend of the [signal-hook] crate.
//!
//! The [signal-hook] crate tries to provide an API to the unix signals, which are a global
//! resource. Therefore, it is desirable an application contains just one version of the crate
//! which manages this global resource. But that makes it impossible to make breaking changes in
//! the API.
//!
//! Therefore, this crate provides very minimal and low level API to the signals that is unlikely
//! to have to change, while there may be multiple versions of the [signal-hook] that all use this
//! low-level API to provide different versions of the high level APIs.
//!
//! It is also possible some other crates might want to build a completely different API. This
//! split allows these crates to still reuse the same low-level routines in this crate instead of
//! going to the (much more dangerous) unix calls.
//!
//! # What this crate provides
//!
//! The only thing this crate does is multiplexing the signals. An application or library can add
//! or remove callbacks and have multiple callbacks for the same signal.
//!
//! It handles dispatching the callbacks and managing them in a way that uses only the
//! [async-signal-safe] functions inside the signal handler. Note that the callbacks are still run
//! inside the signal handler, so it is up to the caller to ensure they are also
//! [async-signal-safe].
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! This is a building block for other libraries creating reasonable abstractions on top of
//! signals. The [signal-hook] is the generally preferred way if you need to handle signals in your
//! application and provides several safe patterns of doing so.
//!
//! # Rust version compatibility
//!
//! Currently builds on 1.26.0 an newer and this is very unlikely to change. However, tests
//! require dependencies that don't build there, so tests need newer Rust version (they are run on
//! stable).
//!
//! Note that this ancient version of rustc no longer compiles current versions of `libc`. If you
//! want to use rustc this old, you need to force your dependency resolution to pick old enough
//! version of `libc` (`0.2.156` was found to work, but newer ones may too).
//!
//! # Portability
//!
//! This crate includes a limited support for Windows, based on `signal`/`raise` in the CRT.
//! There are differences in both API and behavior:
//!
//! - Due to lack of `siginfo_t`, we don't provide `register_sigaction` or `register_unchecked`.
//! - Due to lack of signal blocking, there's a race condition.
//!   After the call to `signal`, there's a moment where we miss a signal.
//!   That means when you register a handler, there may be a signal which invokes
//!   neither the default handler or the handler you register.
//! - Handlers registered by `signal` in Windows are cleared on first signal.
//!   To match behavior in other platforms, we re-register the handler each time the handler is
//!   called, but there's a moment where we miss a handler.
//!   That means when you receive two signals in a row, there may be a signal which invokes
//!   the default handler, nevertheless you certainly have registered the handler.

// This uses a form of RCU. There's an atomic pointer to the current action descriptors (in the
// form of IndependentArcSwap, to be able to track what, if any, signal handlers still use the
// version). A signal handler takes a copy of the pointer and calls all the relevant actions.
//
// Modifications to that are protected by a mutex, to avoid juggling multiple signal handlers at
// once (eg. not calling sigaction concurrently). This should not be a problem, because modifying
// the signal actions should be initialization only anyway. To avoid all allocations and also
// deallocations inside the signal handler, after replacing the pointer, the modification routine
// needs to busy-wait for the reference count on the old pointer to drop to 1 and take ownership ‒
// that way the one deallocating is the modification routine, outside of the signal handler.

/// # Errors
///
/// Since the library manipulates signals using the low-level C functions, all these can return

/// given platform ‒ after a program is debugged and tested on a given OS, it should never return
/// an error.
///
/// However, if an error *is* returned, there are no guarantees if the given action was registered
/// or not.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This function is unsafe, because the `action` is run inside a signal handler. While Rust is
/// somewhat vague about the consequences of such, it is reasonably to assume that similar
/// restrictions as specified in C or C++ apply.
///
/// In particular:
///
/// * Calling any OS functions that are not async-signal-safe as specified as POSIX is not allowed.
/// * Accessing globals or thread-locals without synchronization is not allowed (however, mutexes
///   are not within the async-signal-safe functions, therefore the synchronization is limited to
///   using atomics).
///
/// The underlying reason is, signals are asynchronous (they can happen at arbitrary time) and are
/// run in context of arbitrary thread (with some limited control of at which thread they can run).
/// As a consequence, things like mutexes are prone to deadlocks, memory allocators can likely
/// contain mutexes and the compiler doesn't expect the interruption during optimizations.
///
/// Things that generally are part of the async-signal-safe set (though check specifically) are
/// routines to terminate the program, to further manipulate signals (by the low-level functions,
/// not by this library) and to read and write file descriptors. The async-signal-safety is
/// transitive - that is, a function composed only from computations (with local variables or with
/// variables accessed with proper synchronizations) and other async-signal-safe functions is also
/// safe.
///
/// As panicking from within a signal handler would be a panic across FFI boundary (which is
/// undefined behavior), the passed handler must not panic.
///
/// Note that many innocently-looking functions do contain some of the forbidden routines (a lot of
/// things lock or allocate).
///
/// If you find these limitations hard to satisfy, choose from the helper functions in the
/// [signal-hook](https://docs.rs/signal-hook) crate ‒ these provide safe interface to use some
/// common signal handling patters.
///
/// # Race condition
///
/// Upon registering the first hook for a given signal into this library, there's a short race
/// condition under the following circumstances:
///
/// * The program already has a signal handler installed for this particular signal (through some
///   other library, possibly).
/// * Concurrently, some other thread installs a different signal handler while it is being
///   installed by this library.
/// * At the same time, the signal is delivered.
///
/// Under such conditions signal-hook might wrongly "chain" to the older signal handler for a short
/// while (until the registration is fully complete).
///
/// Note that the exact conditions of the race condition might change in future versions of the
/// library. The recommended way to avoid it is to register signals before starting any additional
/// threads, or at least not to register signals concurrently.
///
/// Alternatively, make sure all signals are handled through this library.
///
/// # Performance
///
/// Even when it is possible to repeatedly install and remove actions during the lifetime of a
/// program, the installation and removal is considered a slow operation and should not be done
/// very often. Also, there's limited (though huge) amount of distinct IDs (they are `u128`).
///
/// # Examples
