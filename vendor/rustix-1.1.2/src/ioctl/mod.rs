//! Unsafe `ioctl` API.
//!
//! Unix systems expose a number of `ioctl`'s. `ioctl`s have been adopted as a
//! general purpose system call for making calls into the kernel. In addition
//! to the wide variety of system calls that are included by default in the
//! kernel, many drivers expose their own `ioctl`'s for controlling their
//! behavior, some of which are proprietary. Therefore it is impossible to make
//! a safe interface for every `ioctl` call, as they all have wildly varying
//! semantics.
//!
//! This module provides an unsafe interface to write your own `ioctl` API. To
//! start, create a type that implements [`Ioctl`]. Then, pass it to [`ioctl`]
//! to make the `ioctl` call.

/// of files, but has since been adopted as a general purpose system call for
/// making calls into the kernel. In addition to the default calls exposed by
/// generic file descriptors, many drivers expose their own `ioctl` calls for
/// controlling their behavior, some of which are proprietary.
///
/// This crate exposes many other `ioctl` interfaces with safe and idiomatic
/// wrappers, like [`ioctl_fionbio`] and [`ioctl_fionread`]. It is recommended
/// to use those instead of this function, as they are safer and more
/// idiomatic. For other cases, implement the [`Ioctl`] API and pass it to this
/// function.
///
/// See documentation for [`Ioctl`] for more information.
///
/// [`ioctl_fionbio`]: crate::io::ioctl_fionbio
/// [`ioctl_fionread`]: crate::io::ioctl_fionread
///
/// # Safety
///
/// While [`Ioctl`] takes much of the unsafety out of `ioctl` calls, callers
/// must still ensure that the opcode value, operand type, and data access
/// correctly reflect what's in the device driver servicing the call. `ioctl`
/// calls form a protocol between the userspace `ioctl` callers and the device
/// drivers in the kernel, and safety depends on both sides agreeing and
/// upholding the expectations of the other.
///
/// And, `ioctl` calls can read and write arbitrary memory and have arbitrary
/// side effects. Callers must ensure that any memory accesses and side effects
/// are compatible with Rust language invariants.

///  - The `ioctl` call expects the input provided by `as_ptr` and produces the

///  - That `output_from_ptr` can safely take the pointer from `as_ptr` and
///    cast it to the correct type, *only* after the `ioctl` call.
///  - That the return value of `opcode` uniquely identifies the `ioctl` call.
///  - That, for whatever platforms you are targeting, the `ioctl` call is safe
///    to make.
///  - If `IS_MUTATING` is false, that no userspace data will be modified by
