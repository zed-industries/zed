# 0.8.11

* Fix receiving IOCP events after deregistering a Windows named pipe
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/pull/1760, backport pr:
  https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/pull/1761).

# 0.8.10

## Added

* Solaris support
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/pull/1724).

# 0.8.9

## Added

  **unsupported** configuration flags to force a specific poll or waker
  implementation

  https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/pull/1685,
  https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/pull/1692).

## Fixed

  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/pull/1722).

  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/pull/1658).

## Changed

* Made the `log` dependency optional behind the `log` feature flag (enabled by
  default). Users that disabled Mio's default features will now not see any
  logging from Mio, enabling the `log` feature will fix that. This was done in
  response to the `log` crate increasing it's MSRV to v1.60, see
  https://github.com/rust-lang/log/pull/552
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/pull/1673).

## Fixed

* A number of potential fd leaks when setup resulted in an error right after
  creation (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/pull/1636).

  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/pull/1555).
* Don't ignore EAGAIN in UDS connect call
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/pull/1564).
* Documentation of `TcpStream::connect`
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/pull/1565).

# 0.8.2

## Added

* Experimental support for Redox.

# 0.8.1

## Added

* Add `try_io` method to all I/O types (#1551). This execute a user defined I/O
  closure while updating Mio's internal state ensuring that the I/O type

  following types:
   * `TcpStream`
   * `UdpSocket`

   * `UnixStream`

  of time type are still missing, e.g. the `Waker`, and may never be possible to
  implement.

# 0.8.0

## Removed

# 0.7.6

## Added

* `net` feature, replaces `tcp`, `udp` and `uds` features

## Fixes

* Incorrect assumption of the layout of `std::net::SocketAddr`. Previously Mio
  would assume that `SocketAddrV{4,6}` had the same layout as
  `libc::sockaddr_in(6)`, however this is not guaranteed by the standard
  library.
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/152e0751f0be1c9b0cbd6778645b76bcb0eba93c).
* Also bumped the miow dependency to version 0.3.6 to solve the same problem as
  above.

# 0.7.5

## Added

* `TcpSocket::get_localaddr()` retrieves local address
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/b41a022b2242eef1969c70c8ba93e04c528dba47).

  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/52e8c2220e87696d20f13561402bcaabba4136ed).

# 0.7.1

## Reduced support for 32-bit Apple targets

In January 2020 Rust reduced its support for 32-bit Apple targets
(https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/01/03/reducing-support-for-32-bit-apple-targets.html).
Starting with v0.7.1 Mio will do the same as we're no longer checking 32 bit
iOS/macOS on our CI.

## Added

* Support for illumos
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/976f2354d0e8fbbb64fba3bf017d7131f9c369a0).
* Report `epoll(2)`'s `EPOLLERR` event as `Event::is_write_closed` if it's the
  only event
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/0c77b5712d675eeb9bd43928b5dd7d22b2c7ac0c).
* Optimised event::Iter::{size_hint, count}

  ~30 minutes effectively infinite
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/d555991f5ee81f6c1eec0fe481557d3d5b8d5ff4).
* Set `SO_NOSIGPIPE` on all sockets (not just UDP) on for Apple targets
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/b8bbdcb0d3236f4c4acb257996d42a88dc9987d9).
* Properly handle `POLL_ABORT` on Windows
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/a98da62b3ed1eeed1770aaca12f46d647e4fa749).
* Improved error handling around failing `SIO_BASE_HANDLE` calls on Windows
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/b15fc18458a79ef8a51f73effa92548650f4e5dc).

## Changed

* On NetBSD we now use `accept4(2)`
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/4e306addc7144f2e02a7e8397c220b179a006a19).
* The package uploaded to crates.io should be slightly smaller
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/eef8d3b9500bc0db957cd1ac68ee128ebc68351f).

## Removed

* Dependency on `lazy_static` on Windows
  (https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/commit/57e4c2a8ac153bc7bb87829e22cf0a21e3927e8a).

# 0.7.0

Version 0.7 of Mio contains various major changes compared to version 0.6.
Overall a large number of API changes have been made to reduce the complexity of
the implementation and remove overhead where possible.

Please refer to the [blog post about
0.7-alpha.1](https://tokio.rs/blog/2019-12-mio-v0.7-alpha.1/) for additional
information.

## Added

* `Interest` structure that replaces `Ready` in registering event sources.
* `Registry` structure that separates the registering and polling functionality.
* `Waker` structure that allows another thread to wake a thread polling `Poll`.
* Unix Domain Socket (UDS) types: `UnixDatagram`, `UnixListener` and
  `UnixStream`.

## Removed

* All code deprecated in 0.6 was removed in 0.7.
* Support for Fuchsia was removed as the code was unmaintained.
* Support for Bitrig was removed, rustc dropped support for it also.
* `UnixReady` was merged into `Ready`.
* Custom user-space readiness queue was removed, this includes the public
  `Registration` and `SetReadiness` types.
* `PollOpt` was removed and all registrations use edge-triggers. See the upgrade
  guide on how to process event using edge-triggers.
* The network types (types in the `net` module) now support only the same API as
  found in the standard library, various methods on the types were removed.
* `TcpStream` now supports vectored I/O.
* `Poll::poll_interruptible` was removed. Instead `Poll::poll` will now return
  an error if one occurs.
* `From<usize>` is removed from `Token`, the internal field is still public, so
  `Token(my_token)` can still be used.

## Changed

* Various documentation improvements were made around correct usage of `Poll`
  and registered event sources. It is recommended to reread the documentation of
  at least `event::Source` and `Poll`.
* Mio now uses Rust 2018 and rustfmt for all code.
* `Event` was changed to be a wrapper around the OS event. This means it can be
  significantly larger on some OSes.
* `Ready` was removed and replaced with various `is_*` methods on `Event`. For
  example instead checking for readable readiness using
  `Event::ready().is_readable()`, you would call `Event::is_readable()`.
* `Ready::is_hup` was removed in favour of `Event::is_read_closed` and
  `Event::is_write_closed`.
* The Iterator implementation of `Events` was changed to return `&Event`.
* `Evented` was renamed to `event::Source` and now takes mutable reference to
  the source.
* Minimum supported Rust version was increased to 1.39.
* By default Mio now uses a shim implementation. To enable the full
  implementation, that uses the OS, enable the `os-oll` feature. To enable the
  network types use `tcp`, `udp` and/or `uds`. For more documentation on the
  features see the `feature` module in the API documentation (requires the
  `extra-docs` feature).
* The entire Windows implementation was rewritten.
* Various optimisation were made to reduce the number of system calls in
  creating and using sockets, e.g. making use of `accept4(2)`.
* The `fmt::Debug` implementation of `Events` is now actually useful as it
  prints all `Event`s.
