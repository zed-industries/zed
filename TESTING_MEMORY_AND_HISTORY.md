# TESTING_MEMORY_AND_HISTORY.md

Comprehensive test suite specification for validating the behavior and robustness of the `memory` and `list_history` tools via an LLM. This document is intended to be executed mentally or by a harness that:
1. Preloads a deterministic conversation (seed history).
2. Executes tool calls in a defined order.
3. Asserts structural and semantic correctness of responses and state transitions.

---

## 1. Scope & Goals

Covers:
- All `memory` operations: store, load, list, prune, restore.
- Every argument of `memory` (including edge combinations).
- All `list_history` arguments and behaviors (pagination, truncation, full markdown inclusion).
- State transition validation (before / after store, prune, restore).
- Negative and edge cases (empty summaries, overlapping prune indices, invalid handles).
- Repeatability guidelines and acceptance criteria patterns.

Not Covered (out of scope):
- Underlying persistence engine durability guarantees.
- Performance, latency benchmarks.
- Cross-session memory carryover.

---

## 2. Seed Conversation History (Precondition)

The following conversation MUST exist (indexes are implicit in chronological order). Message roles (User / Assistant / System) are included so an evaluator can map them if the environment categorizes messages.

Seed messages (indexes 0..14):

| Idx | Role      | Content (abridged description) |
|-----|-----------|--------------------------------|
| 0   | System    | "You are a coding assistant specializing in Rust and clarity." |
| 1   | User      | "Hi, I want help building a GPUI view. Prefer no unwraps." |
| 2   | Assistant | Provides GPUI intro, emphasizes error propagation with '?' |
| 3   | User      | "Track my preferences: Rust clarity, avoid panics, descriptive names." |
| 4   | Assistant | Acknowledges preferences; suggests entity patterns. |
| 5   | User      | "What about concurrency? Spawn vs background_spawn examples please." |
| 6   | Assistant | Explains spawn on foreground vs background_spawn for heavy work. |
| 7   | User      | "Add: I also prefer minimal allocations. Include that in memory." |
| 8   | Assistant | Confirms adding 'minimal allocations' to preferences. |
| 9   | User      | "Show an entity update pattern with shadow cloning." |
| 10  | Assistant | Provides example using variable shadowing. |
| 11  | User      | "Later I might switch to performance focus." |
| 12  | Assistant | Notes potential future shift to performance. |
| 13  | User      | "Summarize my current constraints." |
| 14  | Assistant | Summarizes: clarity > performance (for now), no unwraps, minimal allocations, descriptive names. |

All tests assume this conversation is present when `list_history` initial calls occur unless a test explicitly manipulates indexes via pruning operations (which do NOT actually change the historic transcript, only memory summaries).

## 6. Expected Output Patterns

Because actual schema may vary, define pattern expectations rather than exact JSON:

Common pattern for list:
```
Entries: [
  {
    "handle": "<NON-EMPTY STRING>",
    "preview": "<<= max_preview_chars or full>",
    "length": <int?>,
    "created_at": "<ISO8601?>"
  },
  ...
]
Total: <int>
```

For load:
```
{
  "summaries": [
     {"handle": "Hx", "text": "..."},
     ...
  ]
}
```
OR if singular:
```
{"summary": "..."}
```

For errors:
```
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Description",
    "code": "<validation|not_found|...>"
  }
}
```

---

## 7. Edge & Negative Considerations

| Scenario | Expectation |
|----------|-------------|
| Duplicate store with identical summary | Allowed; distinct handle |
| Prune with both memory_handle and start/end | Prefer explicit handle; ignore range (documentedly) OR error |
| Restore inserting out-of-bounds index | Clamp to end |
| max_preview_chars < 5 | Still honored; truncated safely |
| Large summary ( > 10k chars ) | Should either store or return size error; test if environment allows |

(Optional Stress Test)
```/dev/null/stress_store_large.json#L1-9
{
  "name": "memory",
  "arguments": {
    "operation": "store",
    "summary": "<REPEAT 'A' x 12000>"
  }
}
```

---

## 8. Recommended Execution Order

1. H01â€“H04 (history baseline)
2. M01â€“M05 (initial population)
3. M06â€“M07 (handle prune/restore)
4. M08â€“M11 (range + previews + auto)
5. M12â€“M15 (negative & edge)
6. M16 (final verification)

---

## 9. Sample Consolidated Acceptance Script (Logical Narrative)

Script (human/harness pseudo-flow):

1. Confirm history indexes stable (H01).
2. Store first summary (M01) -> record handle H1.
3. List -> verify H1 (M02).
4. Load -> verify content (M03).
5. Store refined summary -> H2 (M04).
6. List -> two entries (M05).
7. Prune H1 (M06).
8. Restore H1 (M07).
9. Prune by range removing first entry (M08).
10. Restore H2 at index 0 (M09).
11. Store auto summary (M10) -> H3.
12. List with preview cap (M11).
13. Attempt prune invalid handle (M12).
14. Attempt store empty summary (M13).
15. Prune H3 then restore with placeholder replacement (M14).
16. Prune overlapping indices (M15).
17. Load final state (M16).

---

## 10. Example Narrative Summaries to Use

Initial manual summary candidate:
"User prioritizes clarity, safe error handling (no unwrap), descriptive names."

Refined summary:
"Clarity-first; avoid panics; minimal allocations; descriptive naming; performance shift anticipated."

Auto-assisted summary:
"Consolidated: clarity > perf (current), propagate errors with '?', minimize allocations, potential future perf optimization."

Placeholder replacement (if used):
"Merged clarity & future performance watch."

---

## 11. Validation Checklist

| Check | Must Hold |
|-------|-----------|
| Handle uniqueness | All stored entries have unique handles until pruned; restored may reuse or alias (document) |
| Idempotence of list | List does not mutate state |
| Prune accuracy | Only specified entries removed |
| Restore insertion | Entry position matches requested index or spec fallback |
| Preview safety | No multi-byte truncation corruption |
| Negative handling | Invalid operations produce explicit error envelope |
| Final load coherence | No references to pruned-only (non-restored) handles |

---

## 12. Reporting Format (For Harness)

For each test produce:
```
[TEST_ID] RESULT: PASS|FAIL
Request: <serialized invocation>
Response: <raw response>
Assertions:
 - <assertion1>: PASS|FAIL
 - <assertion2>: PASS|FAIL
State After: <list summary handles ordered>
```

---

## 13. Maintenance Notes

- If memory backend changes ordering semantics (e.g. MRU vs chronological), adjust tests M05, M07, M09 accordingly.
- If range prune semantics are clarified (inclusive vs exclusive end), update M08 / M15.
- If automatic summarization (`auto=true`) starts generating internal text ignoring provided summary, adapt M10 acceptance to allow system-generated content with a stability token.

---

## 14. Quick Start Minimal Subset (Smoke)

If only smoke testing:
1. H01
2. M01
3. M02
4. M03
5. M06
6. M07
7. M11
8. M16
