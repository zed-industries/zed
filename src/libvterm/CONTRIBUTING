Bug reports and feature requests can be sent to any of the above resources.

New features, bug patches, etc.. should in the first instance be discussed via
any of the resources listed above, before starting work on the actual code.
There may be future plans or development already in-progress that could be
affected so it is better to discuss the ideas first before starting work
actually writing any code.
