To merge in changes from Github, do this:
- Commit any pending changes.
- Setup the merge tool:
    git config merge.tool vimdiff
    git config merge.conflictstyle diff3
    git config mergetool.prompt false
- Run the merge tool:
    git mergetool
  This will open a four-way diff between:
     LOCAL  - your current version
     BASE   - version as it was at your last sync
     REMOTE - version at head on Github
     MERGED - best-effort merge of LOCAL and REMOTE
  Now find places where automatic merge didn't work, they are marked with
  <<<<<<<<, ======= and >>>>>>>
  Fix those places in MERGED, remove the markers, and save the file :wqall.
