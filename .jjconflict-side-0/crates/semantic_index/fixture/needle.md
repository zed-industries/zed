# Searching for a needle in a haystack

When you have a large amount of text, it can be useful to search for a specific word or phrase. This is often referred to as "finding a needle in a haystack." In this markdown document, we're "hiding" a key phrase for our text search to find. Can you find it?

## Instructions

1. Use the search functionality in your text editor or markdown viewer to find the hidden phrase in this document.

2. Once you've found the **phrase**, write it down and proceed to the next step.

Honestly, I just want to fill up plenty of characters so that we chunk this markdown into several chunks.

## Tips

- Relax
- Take a deep breath
- Focus on the task at hand
- Don't get distracted by other text
- Use the search functionality to your advantage

## Example code

```python
def search_for_needle(haystack, needle):
    if needle in haystack:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

```javascript
function searchForNeedle(haystack, needle) {
  return haystack.includes(needle);
}
```

## Background

When creating an index for a book or searching for a specific term in a large document, the ability to quickly find a specific word or phrase is essential. This is where search functionality comes in handy. However, one should _remember_ that the search is only as good as the index that was built. As they say, garbage in, garbage out!

## Conclusion

Searching for a needle in a haystack can be a challenging task, but with the right tools and techniques, it becomes much easier. Whether you're looking for a specific word in a document or trying to find a key piece of information in a large dataset, the ability to search efficiently is a valuable skill to have.
