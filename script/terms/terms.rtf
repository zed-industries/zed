Usage Data is associated with a secure random telemetry ID which may be linked to Your email address. This linkage currently serves two purposes: (1) it allows Zed to analyze usage patterns over time while maintaining Your privacy; and (2) it enables Zed to reach out to specific user groups for feedback and improvement suggestions. Zed may contact You based on Your usage patterns to better understand your needs and improve the Solution. If You delete Your account, the link between Your telemetry ID and Your email address will be permanently removed.
