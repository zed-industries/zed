# Step 1: Define the parameters for the Space you want to upload to.
SPACE="zed-nightly-host" # Find your endpoint in the control panel, under Settings.
REGION="nyc3" # Must be "us-east-1" when creating new Spaces. Otherwise, use the region in your endpoint (e.g. nyc3).
STORAGETYPE="STANDARD" # Storage type, can be STANDARD, REDUCED_REDUNDANCY, etc.
KEY="???????" # Access key pair. You can create access key pairs using the control panel or API.
SECRET="$SECRET" # Secret access key defined through an environment variable.

# Step 2: Define a function that uploads your object via cURL.
function putS3
{
  path="." # The local path to the file you want to upload.
  file="hello-world.txt" # The file you want to upload.
  space_path="/" # The path within your Space where you want to upload the new file.
  space="${SPACE}"
  date=$(date +"%a, %d %b %Y %T %z")
  acl="x-amz-acl:private" # Defines Access-control List (ACL) permissions, such as private or public.
  content_type="text/plain" # Defines the type of content you are uploading.
  storage_type="x-amz-storage-class:${STORAGETYPE}"
  string="PUT\n\n$content_type\n$date\n$acl\n$storage_type\n/$space$space_path$file"
  signature=$(echo -en "${string}" | openssl sha1 -hmac "${SECRET}" -binary | base64)
  curl -s -X PUT -T "$path/$file" \ # The cURL command that uploads your file.
    -H "Host: $space.${REGION}.digitaloceanspaces.com" \
    -H "Date: $date" \
    -H "Content-Type: $content_type" \
    -H "$storage_type" \
    -H "$acl" \
    -H "Authorization: AWS ${KEY}:$signature" \
    "https://$space.${REGION}.digitaloceanspaces.com$space_path$file"
}

# Step 3: mkdir for file based on release sha
# Step 4: Put Zed.dmg in that directory
for file in "$path"/*; do
  putS3 "$path" "${file##*/}" "nyc-tutorial-space/"
done

# Step 5: Output that directory for next step
