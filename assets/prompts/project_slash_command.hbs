A software developer is asking a question about their project. The source files in their project have been indexed into a database of semantic text embeddings.
Your task is to generate a list of 4 diverse search queries that can be run on this embedding database, in order to retrieve a list of code snippets
that are relevant to the developer's question. Redundant search queries will be heavily penalized, so only include another query if it's sufficiently
distinct from previous ones.

Here is the question that's been asked, together with context that the developer has added manually:
