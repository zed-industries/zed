<edit_suggestions_task_specification>

# Goal

Guide the user through code changes using a series of edit steps, where each step describes a change to a
particular location in a source code file.

# Output Format

Surround each step with an `<edit_step></edit_step>` XML tag. Each `<edit_step>` may contain the following child tags:

## `<path>` (required)

This tag contains the path to the file that will be changed. It can be an existing path, or a path that should be created.

## `<location>` (optional)

This tag contains content from the the file that identifies the location where the change should occur. It can either
be a single excerpt, or a combination of starting excerpt, an ellipsis, and an ending excerpt. If a location is not
specified, the entire file will be considered the location.

## `<within>` (optional)

This tag contains content from the file that identifies a larger region containing the `<location>` content.
It can be useful for disambiguating between multiple similar passages in a file.

## `<operation>` (required)

This tag indicates what type of change should be made, relative to the given location. It can be one of the following:
* `replace`: replace the content in the specified location.
* `delete`: delete the content in the specified location.
* `insert_before`: add new content before the specified location.
* `insert_after`: add new content after the specified location.

After these child tags, each `<edit_step>` must contain a written description of the change that should
be made. The description should begin with a high-level overview, and can contain markdown code blocks as well. The description
should be self-contained and actionable.

# Examples

The following example conversations show how the <edit_step> tags should be used.

<example>
<user>
```rust src/lib.rs
struct Calculator {
    value: i64,
}

impl Calculator {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self { value: 0 }
    }

    pub fn value(&self) -> i64 {
        self.value
    }

    pub fn add(&mut self, operand: i64) -> i64 {
        self.value += operand;
    }
}
```

```rust src/main.rs
use crate::Calculator;

fn main() {
    let mut calc = Calculator::new();
    assert_eq!(calc.value(), 0);

    calc.add(7);
    assert_eq!(calc.value(), 7);

    calc.add(1);
    assert_eq!(calc.value(), 8);
}
```

add subtraction functionality, including assertions
</user>

<assistant>
Here's how to add subtraction functionality to the calculator:

<edit_step>
<path>src/lib.rs</path>
<location>
pub fn add(&mut self, operand: i64) -> i64
...
}
</location>
<within>
impl Calculator {
...
}
</within>
<operation>insert_after</operation>

Add a subtract function to the Calculator struct.

```rust
pub fn subtract(&mut self, operand: i64) -> i64 {
    self.value -= operand;
}
```
</edit_step>

<edit_step>
<path>src/main.rs</path>
<location>
calc.add(1);
assert_eq!(calc.value(), 8);
</location>
<within>
fn main() {
...
}
</within>
<operation>insert_after</operation>

Call the subtract method and assert about the calculator's value.

```rust
calc.subtract(5);
assert_eq!(calc.value(), 3);
```
</edit_step>
