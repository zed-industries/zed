## Engineering

### Github

For now, all the Zed source code lives on [Github](https://github.com/zed-industries). A founder will need to add you to the team and set up the appropriate permissions.

Useful repos:
- [zed-industries/zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) - Zed source
- [zed-industries/zed.dev](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed.dev) - Zed.dev site and collab API
- [zed-industries/docs](https://github.com/zed-industries/docs) - Zed public docs
- [zed-industries/community](https://github.com/zed-industries/community) - Zed community feedback & discussion

### Vercel

We use Vercel for all of our web deployments and some backend things. If you sign up with your `@zed.dev` email you should be invited to join the team automatically. If not, ask a founder to invite you to the Vercel team.

### Environment Variables

You can get access to many of our shared enviroment variables through 1Password and Vercel. For 1Password search the value you are looking for, or sort by passwords or API credentials.

For Vercel, go to `settings` -> `Environment Variables` (either on the entire org, or on a specific project depending on where it is shared.) For a given Vercel project if you have their CLI installed you can use `vercel pull` or `vercel env` to pull values down directly. More on those in their [CLI docs](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/env).
