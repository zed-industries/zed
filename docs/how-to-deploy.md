These docs are intendended to replace both docs.zed.dev and introduce people to how to build Zed from source.

1. `cd docs` from repo root
1. Install the vercel cli if you haven't already
   - `pnpm i -g vercel`
1. `vercel` to deploy if you already have the project linked
1. Otherwise, `vercel login` and `vercel` to link
   - Choose Zed Industries as the team, then `zed-app-docs` as the project

Someone can write a script for this when they have time.
