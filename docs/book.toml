# All of the source URLs are interpreted relative to mdBook, so they must:
# 1. Not start with `/docs`
# 2. End in `.html`
#
# The destination URLs are interpreted relative to `https://zed.dev`.
# - Redirects to other docs pages should end in `.html`
# - You can link to pages on the Zed site by omitting the `/docs` in front of it.
