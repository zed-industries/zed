# Zed Documentation Guidelines

## Voice and Tone

### Core Principles

- **Practical over promotional**: Focus on what users can do, not on selling Zed. Avoid marketing language like "powerful," "revolutionary," or "best-in-class."
- **Honest about limitations**: When Zed lacks a feature or doesn't match another tool's depth, say so directly. Pair limitations with workarounds or alternative workflows.
- **Direct and concise**: Use short sentences. Get to the point. Developers are scanning, not reading novels.
- **Second person**: Address the reader as "you." Avoid "the user" or "one."
- **Present tense**: "Zed opens the file" not "Zed will open the file."

### What to Avoid

- Superlatives without substance ("incredibly fast," "seamlessly integrated")
- Hedging language ("simply," "just," "easily")—if something is simple, the instructions will show it
- Apologetic tone for missing features—state the limitation and move on
- Comparisons that disparage other tools—be factual, not competitive
- Meta-commentary about honesty ("the honest take is...", "to be frank...", "honestly...")—let honesty show through frank assessments, not announcements

## Content Structure

### Page Organization

1. **Start with the goal**: Open with what the reader will accomplish, not background
2. **Front-load the action**: Put the most common task first, edge cases later
3. **Use headers liberally**: Readers scan; headers help them find what they need
4. **End with "what's next"**: Link to related docs or logical next steps

### Section Patterns

For how-to content:
1. Brief context (1-2 sentences max)
2. Steps or instructions
3. Example (code block or screenshot reference)
4. Tips or gotchas (if any)

For reference content:
1. What it is (definition)
2. How to access/configure it
3. Options/parameters table
4. Examples

## Formatting Conventions

### Keybindings

- Use backticks for key combinations: `Cmd+Shift+P`
- Show both macOS and Linux/Windows when they differ: `Cmd+,` (macOS) or `Ctrl+,` (Linux/Windows)
- Use `+` to join simultaneous keys, space for sequences: `Cmd+K Cmd+C`

### Code and Settings

- Inline code for setting names, file paths, commands: `format_on_save`, `.zed/settings.json`, `zed .`
- Code blocks for JSON config, multi-line commands, or file contents
- Always show complete, working examples—not fragments

### Terminal Commands

Use `sh` code blocks for terminal commands, not plain backticks:

```sh
brew install zed-editor/zed/zed
```

Not:
```
brew install zed-editor/zed/zed
```

For single inline commands in prose, backticks are fine: `zed .`

### Tables

Use tables for:
- Keybinding comparisons between editors
- Settings mappings (e.g., VS Code → Zed)
- Feature comparisons with clear columns

Format:
```
| Action | Shortcut | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Open File | `Cmd+O` | Works from any context |
```

### Tips and Notes

Use blockquote format with bold label:
```
> **Tip:** Practical advice that helps bridge gaps or saves time.
```

Reserve tips for genuinely useful information, not padding.

## Writing Guidelines

### Settings Documentation

- **Settings Editor first**: Show how to find and change settings in the UI before showing JSON
- **JSON as secondary**: Present JSON examples as "Or add this to your settings.json" for users who prefer direct editing
- **Complete examples**: Include the full JSON structure, not just the value

### Migration Guides

- **Jobs to be done**: Frame around tasks ("How do I search files?") not features ("File Search Feature")
- **Acknowledge the source**: Respect that users have muscle memory and preferences from their previous editor
- **Keybindings tables**: Essential for migration docs—show what maps, what's different, what's missing
- **Trade-offs section**: Be explicit about what the user gains and loses in the switch

### Feature Documentation

- **Start with the default**: Document the out-of-box experience first
- **Configuration options**: Group related settings together
- **Cross-link generously**: Link to related features, settings reference, and relevant guides

## Terminology

| Use | Instead of |
| --- | --- |
| folder | directory (in user-facing text) |
| project | workspace (Zed doesn't have workspaces) |
| Settings Editor | settings UI, preferences |
| command palette | command bar, action search |
| language server | LSP (spell out first use, then LSP is fine) |
| panel | tool window, sidebar (be specific: "Project Panel," "Terminal Panel") |

## Examples

### Good: Direct and actionable
```
To format on save, open the Settings Editor (`Cmd+,`) and search for `format_on_save`. Set it to `on`.

Or add this to your settings.json:
{
  "format_on_save": "on"
}
```

### Bad: Wordy and promotional
```
Zed provides a powerful and seamless formatting experience. Simply navigate to the settings and you'll find the format_on_save option which enables Zed's incredible auto-formatting capabilities.
```

### Good: Honest about limitations
```
Zed doesn't index your project like IntelliJ does. You open a folder and start working immediately—no waiting. The trade-off: cross-project analysis relies on language servers, which may not go as deep.

**How to adapt:**
- Use `Cmd+Shift+F` for project-wide text search
- Use `Cmd+O` for symbol search (powered by your language server)
```

### Bad: Defensive or dismissive
```
While some users might miss indexing, Zed's approach is actually better because it's faster.
