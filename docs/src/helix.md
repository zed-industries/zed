# Helix Mode

_Work in progress! Not all Helix keybindings are implemented yet._

Zed's Helix mode is an emulation layer that brings Helix-style keybindings and modal editing to Zed. It builds upon Zed's [Vim mode](./vim.md), so much of the core functionality is shared. Enabling `helix_mode` will also enable `vim_mode`.

For a guide on Vim-related features that are also available in Helix mode, please refer to our [Vim mode documentation](./vim.md).

To check the current status of Helix mode, or to request a missing Helix feature, checkout out the ["Are we Helix yet?" discussion](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/discussions/33580).

For a detailed list of Helix's default keybindings, please visit the [official Helix documentation](https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html).
