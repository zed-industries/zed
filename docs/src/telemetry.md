# Telemetry in Zed

**Up to date with v0.112.0**

Zed collects anonymous telemetry data to help the team understand how people are using the application and to see what sort of issues they are experiencing.

## Dataflow

Telemetry is sent from the application to zed.dev. Data is proxied through our servers to enable us to easily switch analytics services; we never store this data. The data is then sent off to various services:

- [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com): Cloud-monitoring service - stores diagnostic events
- [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com): Business Intelligence platform - stores both diagnostic and metric events
- [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com): Dashboards - dashboards built around data pulled from Clickhouse

## Types of Telemetry

### Diagnostics

Diagnostic events include debug information (stack traces) from crash reports. Reports are sent on the first application launch after the crash occurred. We've built dashboards that allow us to visualize the frequency and severity of issues experienced by users. Having these reports sent automatically allows us to begin implementing fixes without the user needing to file a report in our issue tracker. The plots in the dashboards also give us an informal measurement of the stability of Zed.

When a panic occurs, the following data is sent:

#### PanicRequest

- `panic`: The panic data
- `token`: An identifier that is used to authenticate the request on zed.dev

#### Panic

- `thread`: The name of the thread that panicked
- `payload`: The panic message
- `location_data`: The location of the panic
  - `file`
  - `line`
- `backtrace`: The backtrace of the panic
- `app_version`: Zed's app version
- `release_channel`: Zed's release channel
  - `stable`
  - `preview`
  - `dev`
- `os_name`: The name of your operating system
- `os_version`: The version of your operating system
- `architecture`: The architecture of your CPU
- `panicked_on`: The time that the panic occurred
- `installation_id`: An identifier that is unique to each installation of Zed (this differs for stable, preview, and dev builds)
- `session_id`: An identifier that is unique to each Zed session (this differs for each time you open Zed)

### Metrics

Zed also collects metric information based on user actions. Metric events are reported over HTTPS, and requests are rate-limited to avoid using significant network bandwidth. All data remains anonymous, and can't be related to specific Zed users.

The following data is sent:

#### ClickhouseEventRequestBody

- `token`: An identifier that is used to authenticate the request on zed.dev
- `installation_id`: An identifier that is unique to each installation of Zed (this differs for stable, preview, and dev builds)
- `session_id`: An identifier that is unique to each Zed session (this differs for each time you open Zed)
- `is_staff`: A boolean that indicates whether the user is a member of the Zed team or not
- `app_version`: Zed's app version
- `os_name`: The name of your operating system
- `os_version`: The version of your operating system
- `architecture`: The architecture of your CPU
- `release_channel`: Zed's release channel
  - `stable`
  - `preview`
  - `dev`
- `events`: A vector of `ClickhouseEventWrapper`s

#### ClickhouseEventWrapper

- `signed_in`: A boolean that indicates whether the user is signed in or not
- `event`: An enum, where each variant can be one of the following `ClickhouseEvent` variants:

#### ClickhouseEvent

- `editor`
  - `operation`: The editor operation that was performed
    - `open`
    - `save`
  - `file_extension`: The extension of the file that was opened or saved
  - `vim_mode`: A boolean that indicates whether the user is in vim mode or not
  - `copilot_enabled`: A boolean that indicates whether the user has copilot enabled or not
  - `copilot_enabled_for_language`: A boolean that indicates whether the user has copilot enabled for the language of the file that was opened or saved
  - `milliseconds_since_first_event`: Duration of time between this event's timestamp and the timestamp of the first event in the current batch
- `copilot`
  - `suggestion_id`: The ID of the suggestion
  - `suggestion_accepted`: A boolean that indicates whether the suggestion was accepted or not
  - `file_extension`: The file extension of the file that was opened or saved

  - `milliseconds_since_first_event`: Same as above
- `memory`
  - `memory_in_bytes`: The amount of memory used in bytes
  - `virtual_memory_in_bytes`: The amount of virtual memory used in bytes
  - `milliseconds_since_first_event`: Same as above
- `app`
  - `operation`: The app operation that was performed
    - `first open`
    - `open`
    - `close`
  - `milliseconds_since_first_event`: Same as above

You can audit the metrics data that Zed has reported by running the command `zed: open telemetry log` from the command palette, or clicking `Help > View Telemetry Log` in the application menu.

### Configuring Telemetry Settings

You have full control over what data is sent out by Zed. To enable or disable some or all telemetry types, open your `settings.json` file via `zed: open settings` from the command palette. Insert and tweak the following:

```json
"telemetry": {
    "diagnostics": false,
    "metrics": false
},
```

The telemetry settings can also be configured via the `welcome` screen, which can be invoked via the `workspace: welcome` action in the command palette.
