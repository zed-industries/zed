# Themes

Zed comes with a number of built-in themes, with more themes available as extensions.

## Choosing a Theme

You can choose a theme in Zed a few ways:

- by pressing `CMD + K` then `CMD + T`
- by typing `theme` in the command palette
- by editing your `settings.json` with a specific theme name:

```json
{
  "theme": "Ayu Mirage"
}
```

You can also use different themes based on system preferences:

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "mode": "system",
    "light": "One Light",
    "dark": "One Dark"
  }
}
```
