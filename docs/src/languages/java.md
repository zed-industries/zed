# Java

- Tree Sitter: [tree-sitter-java](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-java)
- Language Server: [eclipse.jdt.ls](https://github.com/eclipse-jdtls/eclipse.jdt.ls)

### Setup

Zed installs eclipse.jdt.ls automatically, however the language server cannot start without you first having Java installed and including the path to it in your `PATH` or `JAVA_HOME`.
