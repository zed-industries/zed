# HTML

HTML support is available through the [HTML extension](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/tree/main/extensions/html).

This extension is automatically installed.

If you do not want to use the HTML extension, you can add the following to your settings:

```json
{
  "auto_install_extensions": {
    "html": false
  }
}
```
