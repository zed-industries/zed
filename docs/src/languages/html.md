# HTML

HTML support is available through the [HTML extension](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/tree/main/extensions/html).

- Tree Sitter: [tree-sitter/tree-sitter-html](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-html)
- Language Server: [microsoft/vscode-html-languageservice](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-html-languageservice)

This extension is automatically installed.

If you do not want to use the HTML extension, you can add the following to your settings:

```json
{
  "auto_install_extensions": {
    "html": false
  }
}
```
