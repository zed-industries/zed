3. Open Godot.app and open your project (an example project is fine)
4. In Godot, Editor Menu -> Editor Settings; scroll down the left sidebar to `Text Editor -> External`
   1. Use External Editor: "âœ… On"
   2. Exec path: `/Applications/Zed.app/Contents/MacOS/zed`

## Usage

When Godot is running, the GDScript extension will connect to the language server provided by the Godot runtime and will provide `jump to definition`, hover states when you hold cmd and other language server features.

> Note: If Zed is already running with an existing workspace, spawning from Godot will fail. Quit Zed and it should work again.
