# Go

Go support is available natively in Zed.

- Tree Sitter: [tree-sitter/tree-sitter-go](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-go)
- Language Server: [golang/tools/tree/master/gopls](https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls)

## Setup

We recommend installing gopls via go's package manager and not via Homebrew or your Linux distribution's package manager.

1. Make sure you have uninstalled any version of gopls you have installed via your package manager:

```sh
# MacOS homebrew
brew remove gopls
# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get remove gopls
sudo snap remove gopls
# Arch
sudo pacman -R gopls
```

2. Install/Update `gopls` to the latest version using the go module tool:

```sh
go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest
```

3. Ensure that `gopls` is in your path:

```sh
which gopls
gopls version
```

If `gopls` is not found you will likely need to add `export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"` to your `.zshrc` / `.bash_profile`

## Inlay Hints

Zed sets the following initialization options for inlay hints:

```json
"hints": {
    "assignVariableTypes": true,
    "compositeLiteralFields": true,
    "compositeLiteralTypes": true,
    "constantValues": true,
    "functionTypeParameters": true,
    "parameterNames": true,
    "rangeVariableTypes": true
}
```

to make the language server send back inlay hints when Zed has them enabled in the settings.

Use

```json
"lsp": {
    "gopls": {
        "initialization_options": {
            "hints": {
                ....
            }
        }
    }
}
```

to override these settings.

See [gopls inlayHints documentation](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/inlayHints.md) for more information.
