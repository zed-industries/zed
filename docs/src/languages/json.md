# JSON

JSON support is available natively in Zed.

- Tree Sitter: [tree-sitter/tree-sitter-json](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-json)
- Language Server: [zed-industries/json-language-server](https://github.com/zed-industries/json-language-server)

## JSONC

Zed also supports a super-set of JSON called JSONC, which allows single line comments (`//`) in JSON files.
While editing these files you can use `cmd-/` (MacOS) or `ctrl-/` (Linux) to toggle comments on the current line or selection.

TBD: JSONC Example for how to use `file_types`
TBD: Add formatter (prettier) settings (autoformat, tab_size, etc)
