The Assistant is a powerful tool that integrates large language models into your development workflow.

This section covers various aspects of the Assistant:

- [Inline Assist](./inline-assist.md): Discover how to use the Inline Assist feature to power inline transformations directly within your code editor and terminal.

- [Providers & Configuration](./configuration.md): Configure the Assistant, and set up different language model providers like Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, LM Studio, Google Gemini, and GitHub Copilot Chat.

- [Introducing Contexts](./contexts.md): Learn about contexts (similar to conversations), and learn how they power your interactions between you, your project, and the assistant/model.

- [Using Commands](./commands.md): Explore slash commands that enhance the Assistant's capabilities and future extensibility.

- [Prompting & Prompt Library](./prompting.md): Learn how to write and save prompts, how to use the Prompt Library, and how to edit prompt templates.
