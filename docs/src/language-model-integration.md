# Language model integration

## Assistant Panel

The assistant panel provides you with a way to interact with OpenAI's large language models. The assistant is good for various tasks, such as generating code, asking questions about existing code, and even writing plaintext, such as emails and documentation. To open the assistant panel, toggle the right dock by using the `workspace: toggle right dock` action in the command palette (`cmd-shift-p`).

> **Note**: A default binding can be set to toggle the right dock via the settings.

### Setup

1. Create an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
2. Make sure that your OpenAI account has credits
3. Open the assistant panel, using either the `assistant: toggle focus` or the `workspace: toggle right dock` action in the command palette (`cmd-shift-p`).
4. Make sure the assistant panel is focused:

5. Open the command palette (`cmd-shift-p`) and use the now-available `assistant: reset key` action to set your OpenAI API key:
   ![Enter your OpenAI API key into the field on the right and hit return](https://zed.dev/img/assistant/assistant-reset-key.png)

The OpenAI API key will be saved in your keychain.

Zed will also use the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable if it's defined. If you need to reset your OpenAI API key, focus on the assistant panel and run the command palette action `assistant: reset key`.

### Having a conversation

The assistant editor in Zed functions similarly to any other editor. You can use custom key bindings and work with multiple cursors, allowing for seamless transitions between coding and engaging in discussions with the language models. However, the assistant editor differs with the inclusion of message blocks. These blocks serve as containers for text that correspond to different roles within the conversation. These roles include:

- `You`
- `Assistant`
- `System`

To begin, select a model and type a message in a `You` block.

![Asking a question](https://zed.dev/img/assistant/ask-a-question.png)

As you type, the remaining tokens count for the selected model is updated.

Inserting text from an editor is as simple as highlighting the text and running `cmd->` (`assistant: quote selection`); Zed will wrap it in a fenced code block if it is code.

![Quoting a selection](https://zed.dev/img/assistant/quoting-a-selection.png)

To submit a message, use `cmd-enter` (`assistant: assist`). Unlike typical chat applications where pressing `enter` would submit the message, in the assistant editor, our goal was to make it feel as close to a regular editor as possible. So, pressing `enter` simply inserts a new line.

After submitting a message, the assistant's response will be streamed below, in an `Assistant` message block.

![Receiving an answer](https://zed.dev/img/assistant/receiving-an-answer.png)

The stream can be canceled at any point with `escape`. This is useful if you realize early on that the response is not what you were looking for.

If you want to start a new conversation at any time, you can hit `cmd-n` or use the `New Context` menu option in the hamburger menu at the top left of the panel.

Simple back-and-forth conversations work well with the assistant. However, there may come a time when you want to modify the previous text in the conversation and steer it in a different direction.

### Editing a conversation

The assistant gives you the flexibility to have control over the conversation. You can freely edit any previous text, including the responses from the assistant. If you want to remove a message block entirely, simply place your cursor at the beginning of the block and use the `delete` key. A typical workflow might involve making edits and adjustments throughout the conversation to refine your inquiry or provide additional context. Here's an example:

1. Write text in a `You` block.
2. Submit the message with `cmd-enter`
3. Receive an `Assistant` response that doesn't meet your expectations
4. Cancel the response with `escape`
5. Erase the content of the `Assistant` message block and remove the block entirely
6. Add additional context to your original message
7. Submit the message with `cmd-enter`

Being able to edit previous messages gives you control over how tokens are used. You don't need to start up a new context to correct a mistake or to add additional context and you don't have to waste tokens by submitting follow-up corrections.

Some additional points to keep in mind:

- You are free to change the model type at any point in the conversation.
- You can cycle the role of a message block by clicking on the role, which is useful when you receive a response in an `Assistant` block that you want to edit and send back up as a `You` block.

### Saving and loading conversations

After you submit your first message, a name for your conversation is generated by the language model, and the conversation is automatically saved to your file system in `~/.config/zed/conversations`. You can access and load previous messages by clicking on the hamburger button in the top-left corner of the assistant panel.

### Using a custom API endpoint for OpenAI

You can use a custom API endpoint for OpenAI, as long as it's compatible with the OpenAI API structure.

To do so, add the following to your Zed `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "language_models": {
    "openai": {
      "api_url": "http://localhost:11434/v1"
    }
  }
}
```

The custom URL here is `http://localhost:11434/v1`.

### Using Ollama on macOS

You can use Ollama with the Zed assistant by making Ollama appear as an OpenAPI endpoint.

1. Download, for example, the `mistral` model with Ollama:

   ```
   ollama pull mistral
   ```

2. Make sure that the Ollama server is running. You can start it either via running the Ollama app, or launching:

   ```
   ollama serve
   ```

3. In the assistant panel, select one of the Ollama models using the model dropdown.
4. (Optional) If you want to change the default url that is used to access the Ollama server, you can do so by adding the following settings:

```json
{
  "language_models": {
    "ollama": {
      "api_url": "http://localhost:11434"
    }
  }
}
```

### Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet

You can use Claude with the Zed assistant by choosing it via the model dropdown in the assistant panel.

You need can obtain an API key [here](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).

Even if you pay for Claude Pro, you will still have to [pay for additional credits](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/plans) to use it via the API.

## Inline generation

You can generate and transform text in any editor by selecting text and pressing `ctrl-enter`.
You can also perform multiple generation requests in parallel by pressing `ctrl-enter` with multiple cursors, or by pressing `ctrl-enter` with a selection that spans multiple excerpts in a multibuffer.
To create a custom keybinding that prefills a prompt, you can add the following format in your keymap:

```json
[
  {
    "context": "Editor && mode == full",
    "bindings": {
      "ctrl-shift-enter": [
        "assistant::InlineAssist",
        { "prompt": "Build a snake game" }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

## Advanced: Overriding prompt templates

Zed allows you to override the default prompts used for various assistant features by placing custom Handlebars (.hbs) templates in your `~/.config/zed/prompts/templates` directory. The following templates can be overridden:

1. `content_prompt.hbs`: Used for generating content in the editor.
   Format:

   ```handlebars
   You are an AI programming assistant. Your task is to
   {{#if is_insert}}insert{{else}}rewrite{{/if}}
   {{content_type}}{{#if language_name}} in {{language_name}}{{/if}}
   based on the following context and user request. Context:
   {{#if is_truncated}}
     [Content truncated...]
   {{/if}}
   {{document_content}}
   {{#if is_truncated}}
     [Content truncated...]
   {{/if}}

   User request:
   {{user_prompt}}

   {{#if rewrite_section}}
     Please rewrite the section enclosed in
     <rewrite_this></rewrite_this>
     tags.
   {{else}}
     Please insert your response at the
     <insert_here></insert_here>
     tag.
   {{/if}}

   Provide only the
   {{content_type}}
   content in your response, without any additional explanation.
   ```

2. `terminal_assistant_prompt.hbs`: Used for the terminal assistant feature.
   Format:

   ```handlebars
   You are an AI assistant for a terminal emulator. Provide helpful responses to
   user queries about terminal commands, file systems, and general computer
   usage. System information: - Operating System:
   {{os}}
   - Architecture:
   {{arch}}
   {{#if shell}}
     - Shell:
     {{shell}}
   {{/if}}
   {{#if working_directory}}
     - Current Working Directory:
     {{working_directory}}
   {{/if}}

   Latest terminal output:
   {{#each latest_output}}
     {{this}}
   {{/each}}

   User query:
   {{user_prompt}}

   Provide a clear and concise response to the user's query, considering the
   given system information and latest terminal output if relevant.
   ```

3. `edit_workflow.hbs`: Used for generating the edit workflow prompt.

4. `step_resolution.hbs`: Used for generating the step resolution prompt.

You can customize these templates to better suit your needs while maintaining the core structure and variables used by Zed. Zed will automatically reload your prompt overrides when they change on disk. Consult Zed's assets/prompts directory for current versions you can play with.

Be sure you want to override these, as you'll miss out on iteration on our built in features. This should be primarily used when developing Zed.
