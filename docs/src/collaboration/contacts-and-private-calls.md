# Contacts and Private Calls

Zed allows you to have private calls / collaboration sessions with those in your contacts.
These calls can be one-on-ones or contain any number of users from your contacts.

## Adding a Contact

1. In the collaboration panel, click the `+` button next to the `Contacts` section
1. Search for the contact using their GitHub handle
   _Note: The contact must be an existing Zed user who has completed the GitHub authentication flow._
1. Your contact will receive a notification.
   Once they accept, you'll both appear in each other's contact list.

## Private Calls

Simply click on a contact to start a private call.

_Aside from a few additional features (channel notes, etc.), collaboration in private calls is largely the same as it is in [channels](./channels.md)._
