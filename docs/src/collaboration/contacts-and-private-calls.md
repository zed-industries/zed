# Contacts and Private Calls

In addition to [channels](./channels.md), Zed allows you to have private calls / collaboration sessions with those in your contacts.
These calls can be one-on-ones or contain any number of users from your contacts.

*You will need to [sign in](../../authentication.md#signing-in) in order to begin using Zed's collaboration features.*


## Adding a collaborator to a call

Before you can collaborate, you'll need to add a collaborator to your contacts. To do this:

1. In the collaboration panel, click the `+` button next to the `Contacts` section
2. Search for the contact using their GitHub handle
   _Note: The contact must be an existing Zed user who has completed the GitHub authentication flow._
3. Your contact will receive a notification.
   Once they accept, you'll both appear in each other's contact list.
