# Collaboration

At Zed, we believe that great things are built by great people working together.
We have designed Zed to help individuals work faster and help teams of people work together more effectively.
Zed has two mechanisms for collaborating:

1. [Channels](./channels.md): Ongoing project rooms where team members can share projects, collaborate on code, and maintain ambient awareness of what everyone is working on.
1. [Private Calls](./private-calls.md): Ad-hoc private collaboration with those in your contacts list.

You will need to [sign in](../authentication.md#signing-in) in order to begin using Zed's collaboration features.

> Note: Only collaborate with people that you trust.
> Since sharing a project gives them access to your local file system, you should not share projects with people you do not trust; they could potentially do some nasty things.
>
> In the future, we will do more to prevent this type of access beyond the shared project and add more control over what collaborators can do, but for now, only collaborate with people you trust.
