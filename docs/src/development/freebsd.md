# Unofficial FreeBSD port for Zed Editor

This is an unofficial FreeBSD port for [Zed Editor](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed).

I noticed that there has been great progress around FreeBSD support for Zed recently:

- [Zed running on FreeBSD! (#10247)](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/discussions/10247)
- [Add initial FreeBSD support (#20480)](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/20480)
- [FreeBSD support for remote sessions (#25601)](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/discussions/25601)

As a Arch Linux user, I'm familiar with the AUR (Arch User Repository) ecosystem.
I want to approaching this FreeBSD port effort with a similar mindset.

## Goals

- Build and run Zed on FreeBSD 14.2-RELEASE (amd64)
- Package it as a FreeBSD port (`editors/zed-editor` or similar)
- Track upstream changes and maintain patches as needed
- Help with upstream FreeBSD compatibility improvements if appropriate

---

## Roadmap

- [x] Study previous discussions and pull requests
- [ ] Compile Zed natively on FreeBSD
- [ ] Identify and patch platform-specific issues
- [ ] Write initial FreeBSD port Makefile and patches
- [ ] Test installation via ports system
- [ ] Share working port for community feedback

---

This will initially be an **unofficial** effort.  
However, if maintainers are interested, I'd be happy to collaborate further to make FreeBSD a supported platform in the future!

Thanks again for this amazing editor.  
I'm excited to help bring it to more users!
