# Zed Releases

Read about Zed's [release channels here](https://zed.dev/faq#what-are-the-release-channels).

## Wednesday Release Process

You will need write access to the Zed repository to do this.

Credentials for various services used in this process can be found in 1Password.

Use the `releases` Slack channel to notify the team that releases will be starting.
This is mostly a formality on Wednesday's minor update releases, but can be beneficial when doing patch releases, as other devs may have landed fixes they'd like to cherry pick.

---

1. Checkout `main` and ensure your working copy is clean.

1. Run `git fetch && git pull` to ensure you have the latest commits locally.

1. Run `git fetch --tags --force` to forcibly ensure your local tags are in sync with the remote.

1. Run `./script/get-stable-channel-release-notes`.

   - Follow the instructions at the end of the script and aggregate the release notes into one structure.

1. Run `./script/bump-zed-minor-versions`.

   - Push the tags and branches as instructed.

1. Run `./script/get-preview-channel-changes`.

   - Take the script's output and build release notes by organizing each release note line into a category.
   - Use a prior release for the initial outline.
   - Make sure to append the `Credit` line, if present, to the end of the release note line.

1. Once release drafts are up on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/releases), paste both preview and stable release notes into each and **save**.

   - **Do not publish the drafts!**

1. Check the release assets.

   - Ensure the stable and preview release jobs have finished without error.
   - Ensure each draft has the proper number of assets—releases currently have 10 assets each.
   - Download the artifacts for each release draft and test that you can run them locally.

1. Publish the drafts.

   - Publish stable and preview drafts, one at a time.
     - Use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/zed-industries/zed-dev) to check the progress of the website rebuild.
       The release will be public once the rebuild has completed.

1. Post the stable release notes to social media.

   - Bluesky and X posts will already be built as drafts in [Buffer](https://buffer.com).
   - Publish both, one at a time, ensuring both are posted to each respective platform.

1. Send the stable release notes email.

   - The email broadcast will already be built as a draft in [Kit](https://kit.com).

1. Build social media posts based on the popular items in preview.

   - Draft the copy in the [tweets](https://zed.dev/channel/tweets-23331) channel.
   - Create the preview media (videos, screenshots).
     - For features that you film videos around, try to create alternative photo-only versions to be used in the email, as videos and GIFs aren't great for email.
     - Store all created media in `Feature Media` in our Google Drive.
   - Build X and Bluesky post drafts (copy and media) in [Buffer](https://buffer.com), to be sent for next week's stable release.

   **Note: These are preview items and you may discover bugs.**
   **This is a very good time to report these findings to the team!**

1. Build email based on the popular items in preview.

   - You can reuse the copy and photo media from the preview social media posts.
   - Create a draft email in [Kit](https://kit.com), to be sent for next week's stable release.

## Patch Release Process

If your PR fixes a panic or a crash, you should cherry-pick it to the current stable and preview branches.
If your PR fixes a regression in recently released code, you should cherry-pick it to preview.

You will need write access to the Zed repository to do this:

---

1. Send a PR containing your change to `main` as normal.

1. Once it is merged, cherry-pick the commit locally to either of the release branches (`v0.XXX.x`).

   - In some cases, you may have to handle a merge conflict.
     More often than not, this will happen when cherry-picking to stable, as the stable branch is more "stale" than the preview branch.

1. After the commit is cherry-picked, run `./script/trigger-release {preview|stable}`.
   This will bump the version numbers, create a new release tag, and kick off a release build.

   - This can also be run from the [GitHub Actions UI](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/actions/workflows/bump_patch_version.yml):

1. Once release drafts are up on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/releases), proofread and edit the release notes as needed and **save**.

   - **Do not publish the drafts, yet.**

1. Check the release assets.

   - Ensure the stable / preview release jobs have finished without error.
   - Ensure each draft has the proper number of assets—releases currently have 10 assets each.
   - Download the artifacts for each release draft and test that you can run them locally.

1. Publish stable / preview drafts, one at a time.
   - Use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/zed-industries/zed-dev) to check the progress of the website rebuild.
     The release will be public once the rebuild has completed.

## Nightly release process

In addition to the public releases, we also have a nightly build that we encourage employees to use.
Nightly is released by cron once a day, and can be shipped as often as you'd like.
There are no release notes or announcements, so you can just merge your changes to main and run `./script/trigger-release nightly`.
