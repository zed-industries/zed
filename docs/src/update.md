# Update Zed

Zed is designed to keep itself up to date automatically. You can always update this behavior in your settings.

## Auto-updates

By default, Zed checks for updates and installs them automatically the next time you restart the app. Youâ€™ll always be running the latest version with no extra steps.

If an update is available, Zed will download it in the background and apply it on restart.

## How to check your current version

To check which version of Zed you're using:

Open the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P on macOS, Ctrl+Shift+P on Linux/Windows).

Type and select `zed: about`. A modal will appear with your version information.

## How to control update behavior

If you want to turn off auto-updates, open the Settings Editor (Cmd ,) and find `Auto Update` under General Settings.
