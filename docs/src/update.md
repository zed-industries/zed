# Update Zed

Zed is designed to keep itself up to date automatically. You can always update this behavior in your settings. 

## Auto-updates

By default, Zed checks for updates and installs them automatically the next time you restart the app. You’ll always be running the latest version with no extra steps.

If an update is available, Zed will download it in the background and apply it on restart. 

## How to check your current version

To check which version of Zed you're using:

Open the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P on macOS, Ctrl+Shift+P on Linux/Windows).

Type and select Show Zed Version.

## Manually restarting to apply an update

If Zed has an update ready but hasn't restarted yet:

Use the Restart Zed command from the Command Palette to apply it right away.

## How to control update behavior

Zed is built to stay out of your way, but if you're looking for more control over update timing or channels (e.g. opting into pre-release builds), stay tuned — configuration options are coming in a future update.
