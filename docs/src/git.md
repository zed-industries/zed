# Git

Zed currently supports the following Git features:

- Diff indicators in buffers and editor scrollbars
- Git status in the project panel
- Branch creating and switching
- Git blame viewing

More advanced Git features—like staging and committing changes or viewing history within Zed—will be coming in the future.
