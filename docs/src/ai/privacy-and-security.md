# Privacy and Security

## Philosophy

Zed aims to collect only the minimum data necessary to serve and improve our product.

Data sharing is opt-in by default. Privacy is not a setting to toggle—it's the baseline.

As an open-source product, we believe in maximal transparency, and invite you to examine our codebase. If you find issues, we encourage you to share them with us.

Zed, including AI features, works without sharing data with us and without authentication.

## Documentation

- [AI Improvement](./ai-improvement.md): Zed's opt-in-only approach to data collection for AI improvement, whether our Agentic offering or Edit Predictions.

- [Accounts](../authentication.md): When and why you'd need to authenticate into Zed, how to do so, and what scope we need from you.
