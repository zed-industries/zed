# Privacy and Security

## Philosophy

Zed aims to collect on the minimum data necessary to serve and improve our product.

We believe in opt-in data sharing as the default in building AI products, rather than opt-out, like most of our competitors. Privacy Mode is not a setting to be toggled, it's a default stance.

As an open-source product, we believe in maximal transparency, and invite you to examine our codebase. If you find issues, we encourage you to share them with us.

It is entirely possible to use Zed, including Zed's AI capabilities, without sharing any data with us and without authenticating into the product. We're happy to always support this desired use pattern.
