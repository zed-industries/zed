# Models

Zed’s plans offer hosted versions of major LLMs, generally with higher rate limits than using your API keys.
We’re working hard to expand the models supported by Zed’s subscription offerings, so please check back often.

## Usage {#usage}

Any usage of a Zed-hosted model will be billed at the Zed Price (rightmost column above). See [Plans and Usage](./plans-and-usage.md) for details on Zed's plans and limits for use of hosted models.

> We encourage you to think through what model is best for your needs before leaving the Agent Panel to work. All LLMs can "spiral" and occasionally enter unending loops that require user intervention.

## Context Windows {#context-windows}

A context window is the maximum span of text and code an LLM can consider at once, including both the input prompt and output generated by the model.

| Model             | Provider  | Zed-Hosted Context Window |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| Claude Opus 4.1   | Anthropic | 200k                      |
| Claude Sonnet 4   | Anthropic | 200k                      |
| Claude Sonnet 3.7 | Anthropic | 200k                      |
| GPT-5             | OpenAI    | 400k                      |
| GPT-5 mini        | OpenAI    | 400k                      |
| GPT-5 nano        | OpenAI    | 400k                      |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro    | Google    | 200k                      |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash  | Google    | 200k                      |

> We're planning on expanding supported context windows for hosted Sonnet 4 and Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash in the near future. Stay tuned!

Each Agent thread and text thread in Zed maintains its own context window.
The more prompts, attached files, and responses included in a session, the larger the context window grows.

For best results, it’s recommended you take a purpose-based approach to Agent thread management, starting a new thread for each unique task.

## Tool Calls {#tool-calls}

Models can use [tools](./tools.md) to interface with your code, search the web, and perform other useful functions.
