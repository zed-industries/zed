# Agent Settings

Settings for Zed's Agent Panel, including model selection, UI preferences, and tool permissions.

## Model Settings {#model-settings}

### Default Model {#default-model}

If you're using [Zed's hosted LLM service](./subscription.md), it sets `claude-sonnet-4` as the default model for agentic work (agent panel, inline assistant) and `gpt-5-nano` as the default "fast" model (thread summarization, git commit messages). If you're not subscribed or want to change these defaults, you can manually edit the `default_model` object in your settings:

```json [settings]
{
  "agent": {
    "default_model": {
      "provider": "openai",
      "model": "gpt-4o"
    }
  }
}
```

### Feature-specific Models {#feature-specific-models}

You can assign distinct and specific models for the following AI-powered features:

- Thread summary model: Used for generating thread summaries
- Inline assistant model: Used for the inline assistant feature
- Commit message model: Used for generating Git commit messages

```json [settings]
{
  "agent": {
    "default_model": {
      "provider": "zed.dev",
      "model": "claude-sonnet-4"
    },
    "inline_assistant_model": {
      "provider": "anthropic",
      "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet"
    },
    "commit_message_model": {
      "provider": "openai",
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini"
    },
    "thread_summary_model": {
      "provider": "google",
      "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"
    }
  }
}
```

> If a custom model isn't set for one of these features, they automatically fall back to using the default model.

### Alternative Models for Inline Assists {#alternative-assists}

With the Inline Assistant in particular, you can send the same prompt to multiple models at once.

Here's how you can customize your `settings.json` to add this functionality:

```json [settings]
{
  "agent": {
    "default_model": {
      "provider": "zed.dev",
      "model": "claude-sonnet-4"
    },
    "inline_alternatives": [
      {
        "provider": "zed.dev",
        "model": "gpt-4-mini"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

When multiple models are configured, you'll see in the Inline Assistant UI buttons that allow you to cycle between outputs generated by each model.

The models you specify here are always used in _addition_ to your [default model](#default-model).

For example, the following configuration will generate three outputs for every assist.
One with Claude Sonnet 4 (the default model), another with GPT-5-mini, and another one with Gemini 2.5 Flash.

```json [settings]
{
  "agent": {
    "default_model": {
      "provider": "zed.dev",
      "model": "claude-sonnet-4"
    },
    "inline_alternatives": [
      {
        "provider": "zed.dev",
        "model": "gpt-4-mini"
      },
      {
        "provider": "zed.dev",
        "model": "gemini-2.5-flash"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Model Temperature

Specify a custom temperature for a provider and/or model:

```json [settings]
"model_parameters": [
  // To set parameters for all requests to OpenAI models:
  {
    "provider": "openai",
    "temperature": 0.5
  },
  // To set parameters for all requests in general:
  {
    "temperature": 0
  },
  // To set parameters for a specific provider and model:
  {
    "provider": "zed.dev",
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4",
    "temperature": 1.0
  }
],
```

## Agent Panel Settings {#agent-panel-settings}

Note that some of these settings are also surfaced in the Agent Panel's settings UI, which you can access either via the `agent: open settings` action or by the dropdown menu on the top-right corner of the panel.

### Default View

Use the `default_view` setting to change the default view of the Agent Panel.
You can choose between `thread` (the default) and `text_thread`:

```json [settings]
{
  "agent": {
    "default_view": "text_thread"
  }
}
```

### Font Size

Use the `agent_font_size` setting to change the font size of rendered agent responses in the panel.

```json [settings]
{
  "agent": {
    "agent_font_size": 18
  }
}
```

> Editors in the Agent Panel—whether that is the main message textarea or previous messages—use monospace fonts and therefore, are controlled by the `buffer_font_size` setting, which is defined globally in your `settings.json`.

### Default Tool Permissions

Control the default behavior for tool actions. The default value is `"confirm"`.

- `"confirm"` - Prompts for approval before running any tool action (default)
- `"allow"` - Auto-approves tool actions without prompting
- `"deny"` - Blocks all tool actions

```json [settings]
{
  "agent": {
    "tool_permissions": {
      "default": "allow"
    }
  }
}
```

Even with `default: "allow"`, per-tool `always_deny` and `always_confirm` patterns are still respected, allowing you to maintain safety guardrails for specific commands.

### Per-tool Permission Rules {#per-tool-permission-rules}

You can configure fine-grained permission rules for individual tools using the `tools` key inside `tool_permissions`. Each tool entry supports a `default` and three pattern lists: `always_allow`, `always_deny`, and `always_confirm`. Patterns are regular expressions matched against the tool's input (e.g., the command string for `terminal`, the file path for `edit_file`, etc.).

```json [settings]
{
  "agent": {
    "tool_permissions": {
      "default": "allow",
      "tools": {
        "terminal": {
          "default": "allow",
          "always_deny": [{ "pattern": "rm\\s+-rf" }],
          "always_allow": [{ "pattern": "^git\\s" }],
          "always_confirm": [{ "pattern": "sudo" }]
        },
        "edit_file": {
          "always_deny": [{ "pattern": "\\.env$" }]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Pattern Precedence

Rules are evaluated in the following order (highest priority first):

1. **Hardcoded security rules** — Built-in rules (e.g., blocking `rm -rf /`) that cannot be overridden.
2. **`always_deny`** — If any deny pattern matches, the tool call is blocked immediately.
3. **`always_confirm`** — If any confirm pattern matches (and no deny matched), the user is prompted.
4. **`always_allow`** — If any allow pattern matches (and no deny/confirm matched), the tool call proceeds without prompting. For `terminal` commands with chaining (`&&`, `||`, `;`), **all** sub-commands must match an allow pattern.
5. **Tool-specific `default`** — Used when no patterns match.
6. **Global `default`** — Falls back to `tool_permissions.default` when there is no tool-specific default.

Patterns are case-insensitive by default. Set `"case_sensitive": true` on an individual pattern for exact matching:

```json [settings]
{
  "agent": {
    "tool_permissions": {
      "tools": {
        "terminal": {
          "always_deny": [{ "pattern": "PRODUCTION", "case_sensitive": true }]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### `copy_path` and `move_path` Patterns

For `copy_path` and `move_path` tools, permission patterns are matched independently against both the source path and the destination path. A deny match on **either** path blocks the entire operation. If either path triggers an `always_confirm` match (and neither is denied), the user is prompted for confirmation.

For example, the following rule prevents copying or moving anything into a `secrets/` directory _or_ out of one:

```json [settings]
{
  "agent": {
    "tool_permissions": {
      "tools": {
        "copy_path": {
          "always_deny": [{ "pattern": "^secrets/" }]
        },
        "move_path": {
          "always_deny": [{ "pattern": "^secrets/" }]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### MCP and External Tool Permissions

MCP tools can also have per-tool defaults using the key format `mcp:server_name:tool_name`:

```json [settings]
{
  "agent": {
    "tool_permissions": {
      "tools": {
        "mcp:github:create_issue": {
          "default": "allow"
        },
        "mcp:filesystem:write_file": {
          "default": "deny"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For MCP tools running inside the native Zed agent, the `default` key is the primary mechanism for controlling permissions. Pattern-based rules (`always_allow`, `always_deny`, `always_confirm`) are evaluated against an empty string, so most patterns won't match. However, patterns that can match an empty string (such as `.*` or `^$`) will still take effect — keep this in mind if you use broad catch-all patterns.

For external ACP tools (including MCP servers running through an ACP bridge), patterns are matched against the tool call's **title** as provided by the server. This means pattern matching for ACP tools is best-effort and depends on the server providing descriptive titles.

### Single-file Review

Control whether to display review actions (accept & reject) in single buffers after the agent is done performing edits.
The default value is `false`.

```json [settings]
{
  "agent": {
    "single_file_review": true
  }
}
```

When set to false, these controls are only available in the multibuffer review tab.

### Sound Notification

Control whether to hear a notification sound when the agent is done generating changes or needs your input.
The default value is `false`.

```json [settings]
{
  "agent": {
    "play_sound_when_agent_done": true
  }
}
```

### Message Editor Size

Use the `message_editor_min_lines` setting to control the minimum number of lines of height the agent message editor should have.
It is set to `4` by default, and the max number of lines is always double of the minimum.

```json [settings]
{
  "agent": {
    "message_editor_min_lines": 4
  }
}
```

### Modifier to Send

Require a modifier (`cmd` on macOS, `ctrl` on Linux) to send messages. Prevents accidental sends while editing.
The default value is `false`.

```json [settings]
{
  "agent": {
    "use_modifier_to_send": true
  }
}
```

### Edit Card

Use the `expand_edit_card` setting to control whether edit cards show the full diff in the Agent Panel.
It is set to `true` by default, but if set to false, the card's height is capped to a certain number of lines, requiring a click to be expanded.

```json [settings]
{
  "agent": {
    "expand_edit_card": false
  }
}
```

### Terminal Card

Use the `expand_terminal_card` setting to control whether terminal cards show the command output in the Agent Panel.
It is set to `true` by default, but if set to false, the card will be fully collapsed even while the command is running, requiring a click to be expanded.

```json [settings]
{
  "agent": {
    "expand_terminal_card": false
  }
}
```

### Feedback Controls

Control whether to display the thumbs up/down buttons at the bottom of each agent response, allowing you to give Zed feedback about the agent's performance.
The default value is `true`.

```json [settings]
{
  "agent": {
    "enable_feedback": false
  }
}
```
