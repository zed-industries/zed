# Plans and Usage

## Available Plans {#plans}

For costs and more information on pricing, visit [Zed’s pricing page](https://zed.dev/pricing).

Please note that if you’re interested in just using Zed as the world’s fastest editor, with no AI or subscription features, you can always do so for free, without [authentication](../accounts.md).

## Usage {#usage}

Usage of Zed's hosted models is measured on a token basis, converted to dollars at the rates lists on [the Models page](./models.md) (list price from the provider, +10%).

Zed Pro comes with $5 of monthly dollar credit. A trial of Zed Pro includes $20 of credit, usable for 14 days. Monthly included credit resets on your monthly billing date.

To view your current usage, you can visit your account at [zed.dev/account](https://zed.dev/account). Information from our metering and billing provider, Orb, is embedded on that page.
