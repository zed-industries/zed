# Configuring Custom API Keys

While Zed offers hosted versions of models through our various plans, we're always happy to support users wanting to supply their own API keys for LLM providers.

> Using your own API keys is **_free_** - you do not need to subscribe to a Zed plan to use our AI features with your own keys.

## Providers {#providers}

To access the Assistant configuration view, run `assistant: show configuration` in the command palette, or click on the hamburger menu at the top-right of the Assistant Panel and select "Configure".

Below you can find all the supported providers available so far.

### Anthropic {#anthropic}

> ðŸ”¨Supports tool use

You can use Anthropic models with the Zed assistant by choosing it via the model dropdown in the assistant panel.

1. Sign up for Anthropic and [create an API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
2. Make sure that your Anthropic account has credits
3. Open the configuration view (`assistant: show configuration`) and navigate to the Anthropic section
4. Enter your Anthropic API key

Even if you pay for Claude Pro, you will still have to [pay for additional credits](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/plans) to use it via the API.

Zed will also use the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable if it's defined.

#### Anthropic Custom Models {#anthropic-custom-models}

You can add custom models to the Anthropic provider by adding the following to your Zed `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "language_models": {
    "anthropic": {
      "available_models": [
        {
          "name": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
          "display_name": "Sonnet 2024-June",
          "max_tokens": 128000,

            "max_cache_anchors": 10,
            "min_total_token": 10000,
            "should_speculate": false
          },
          "tool_override": "some-model-that-supports-toolcalling"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Custom models will be listed in the model dropdown in the assistant panel.

You can configure a model to use [extended thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/extended-thinking-models) (if it supports it),
by changing the mode in of your models configuration to `thinking`, for example:

```json
{
  "name": "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
  "display_name": "claude-3-7-sonnet-thinking",
  "max_tokens": 200000,
  "mode": {
    "type": "thinking",
    "budget_tokens": 4_096
  }
}
```

### GitHub Copilot Chat {#github-copilot-chat}

> ðŸ”¨Supports tool use in some cases.
> See [here](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/9e0330ba7d848755c9734bf456c716bddf0973f3/crates/language_models/src/provider/copilot_chat.rs#L189-L198) for the supported subset

You can use GitHub Copilot chat with the Zed assistant by choosing it via the model dropdown in the assistant panel.

### Google AI {#google-ai}

> ðŸ”¨Supports tool use

You can use Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash with the Zed assistant by choosing it via the model dropdown in the assistant panel.

1. Go the Google AI Studio site and [create an API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2. Open the configuration view (`assistant: show configuration`) and navigate to the Google AI section
3. Enter your Google AI API key and press enter.

The Google AI API key will be saved in your keychain.

Zed will also use the `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` environment variable if it's defined.

#### Google AI custom models {#google-ai-custom-models}

By default Zed will use `stable` versions of models, but you can use specific versions of models, including [experimental models](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/experimental-models) with the Google AI provider by adding the following to your Zed `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "language_models": {
    "google": {
      "available_models": [
        {
          "name": "gemini-1.5-flash-latest",
          "display_name": "Gemini 1.5 Flash (Latest)",
          "max_tokens": 1000000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Custom models will be listed in the model dropdown in the assistant panel.

### Ollama {#ollama}

> ðŸ”¨Supports tool use

Download and install Ollama from [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download) (Linux or macOS) and ensure it's running with `ollama --version`.

1. Download one of the [available models](https://ollama.com/models), for example, for `mistral`:

   ```sh
   ollama pull mistral
   ```

2. Make sure that the Ollama server is running. You can start it either via running Ollama.app (MacOS) or launching:

   ```sh
   ollama serve
   ```

3. In the assistant panel, select one of the Ollama models using the model dropdown.

#### Ollama Context Length {#ollama-context}

Zed has pre-configured maximum context lengths (`max_tokens`) to match the capabilities of common models. Zed API requests to Ollama include this as `num_ctx` parameter, but the default values do not exceed `16384` so users with ~16GB of ram are able to use most models out of the box. See [get_max_tokens in ollama.rs](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/crates/ollama/src/ollama.rs) for a complete set of defaults.

**Note**: Tokens counts displayed in the assistant panel are only estimates and will differ from the models native tokenizer.

Depending on your hardware or use-case you may wish to limit or increase the context length for a specific model via settings.json:

```json
{
  "language_models": {
    "ollama": {
      "api_url": "http://localhost:11434",
      "available_models": [
        {
          "name": "qwen2.5-coder",
          "display_name": "qwen 2.5 coder 32K",
          "max_tokens": 32768
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If you specify a context length that is too large for your hardware, Ollama will log an error. You can watch these logs by running: `tail -f ~/.ollama/logs/ollama.log` (MacOS) or `journalctl -u ollama -f` (Linux). Depending on the memory available on your machine, you may need to adjust the context length to a smaller value.

You may also optionally specify a value for `keep_alive` for each available model. This can be an integer (seconds) or alternately a string duration like "5m", "10m", "1h", "1d", etc., For example `"keep_alive": "120s"` will allow the remote server to unload the model (freeing up GPU VRAM) after 120seconds.

### OpenAI {#openai}

> ðŸ”¨Supports tool use

1. Visit the OpenAI platform and [create an API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
2. Make sure that your OpenAI account has credits
3. Open the configuration view (`assistant: show configuration`) and navigate to the OpenAI section
4. Enter your OpenAI API key

The OpenAI API key will be saved in your keychain.

Zed will also use the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable if it's defined.

#### OpenAI Custom Models {#openai-custom-models}

The Zed Assistant comes pre-configured to use the latest version for common models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini). If you wish to use alternate models, perhaps a preview release or a dated model release or you wish to control the request parameters you can do so by adding the following to your Zed `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "language_models": {
    "openai": {
      "available_models": [
        {
          "name": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
          "display_name": "GPT 4o Summer 2024",
          "max_tokens": 128000
        },
        {
          "name": "o1-mini",
          "display_name": "o1-mini",
          "max_tokens": 128000,
          "max_completion_tokens": 20000
        }
      ],
      "version": "1"
    }
  }
}
```

You must provide the model's Context Window in the `max_tokens` parameter, this can be found [OpenAI Model Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models). OpenAI `o1` models should set `max_completion_tokens` as well to avoid incurring high reasoning token costs. Custom models will be listed in the model dropdown in the assistant panel.

### DeepSeek {#deepseek}

> ðŸš« Does not support tool use ðŸš«

1. Visit the DeepSeek platform and [create an API key](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys)
2. Open the configuration view (`assistant: show configuration`) and navigate to the DeepSeek section
3. Enter your DeepSeek API key

The DeepSeek API key will be saved in your keychain.

Zed will also use the `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable if it's defined.

#### DeepSeek Custom Models {#deepseek-custom-models}

The Zed Assistant comes pre-configured to use the latest version for common models (DeepSeek Chat, DeepSeek Reasoner). If you wish to use alternate models or customize the API endpoint, you can do so by adding the following to your Zed `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "language_models": {
    "deepseek": {
      "api_url": "https://api.deepseek.com",
      "available_models": [
        {
          "name": "deepseek-chat",
          "display_name": "DeepSeek Chat",
          "max_tokens": 64000
        },
        {
          "name": "deepseek-reasoner",
          "display_name": "DeepSeek Reasoner",
          "max_tokens": 64000,
          "max_output_tokens": 4096
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Custom models will be listed in the model dropdown in the assistant panel. You can also modify the `api_url` to use a custom endpoint if needed.

### OpenAI API Compatible{#openai-api-compatible}

Zed supports using OpenAI compatible APIs by specifying a custom `endpoint` and `available_models` for the OpenAI provider.

#### X.ai Grok

Example configuration for using X.ai Grok with Zed:

```json
  "language_models": {
    "openai": {
      "api_url": "https://api.x.ai/v1",
      "available_models": [
        {
          "name": "grok-beta",
          "display_name": "X.ai Grok (Beta)",
          "max_tokens": 131072
        }
      ],
      "version": "1"
    },
  }
```
