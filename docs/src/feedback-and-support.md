# Feedback and Support

## Frequently asked questions

Our [FAQ](https://zed.dev/faq) is a great place to start for common questions about Zed.

## Community repository

We track our issues at [`zed-industries/zed`](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues).

### Feature requests

Try to focus on the things that are most critical to you rather than exhaustively listing all features another editor you have used has.

Command palette: `request feature`

### Bug reports

Try to add as much detail as possible, if it is not obvious to reproduce. Let us know how severe the problem is for you; is the issue more of a minor inconvenience or something that would prevent you from using Zed?

Command palette: `file bug report`

## In-app feedback

Feedback can be submitted from within Zed via the feedback modal (command palette: `give feedback`).
