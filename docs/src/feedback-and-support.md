Use the [community forum](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/discussions) to ask questions and learn from one another. We will be present in the forum and answering questions as well.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Our [FAQ](https://zed.dev/faq) is a great place to start for common questions about Zed.

## Issue Tracking

We track our issues at [`zed-industries/zed`](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues).

### Feature Requests

Try to focus on the things that are most critical to you rather than exhaustively listing all features another editor you have used has.

Command palette: `zed: request feature`

### Bug Reports

Try to add as much detail as possible, if it is not obvious to reproduce. Let us know how severe the problem is for you; is the issue more of a minor inconvenience or something that would prevent you from using Zed?

Command palette: `zed: file bug report`

## Feedback Channels

In-app feedback can be submitted from within Zed via the feedback modal.

Command palette: `feedback: give feedback`

If you prefer to write up your thoughts as an email, you can send them to [hi@zed.dev](mailto:hi@zed.dev).

## Merch Store

We have a [merch store](https://zedindustries.creator-spring.com/) where you can buy Zed stickers, shirts, and more.
