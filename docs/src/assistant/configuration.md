# Configuring the Assistant

## Providers {#providers}

The following providers are supported:

- [Zed AI (Configured by default when signed in)](#zed-ai)
- [Anthropic](#anthropic)
- [GitHub Copilot Chat](#github-copilot-chat) [^1]
- [Google AI](#google-ai) [^1]
- [Ollama](#ollama)

To configure different providers, run `assistant: show configuration` in the command palette, or click on the hamburger menu at the top-right of the assistant panel and select "Configure".

To further customize providers, you can use `settings.json` to do that as follows:

- [Configuring endpoints](#custom-endpoint)
- [Configuring timeouts](#provider-timeout)
- [Configuring default model](#default-model)

### Zed AI {#zed-ai}

A hosted service providing convenient and performant support for AI-enabled coding in Zed, powered by Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and accessible just by signing in.

### Anthropic {#anthropic}

You can use Claude 3.5 Sonnet via [Zed AI](#zed-ai) for free. To use other Anthropic models you will need to configure it by providing your own API key.

1. Sign up for Anthropic and [create an API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
2. Make sure that your Anthropic account has credits
3. Open the configuration view (`assistant: show configuration`) and navigate to the Anthropic section
4. Enter your Anthropic API key

Even if you pay for Claude Pro, you will still have to [pay for additional credits](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/plans) to use it via the API.

Zed will also use the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable if it's defined.

#### Anthropic Custom Models {#anthropic-custom-models}

You can add custom models to the Anthropic provider by adding the following to your Zed `settings.json`:

```json
{

          "name": "some-model",

   ```sh
   ollama serve
   ```

3. In the assistant panel, select one of the Ollama models using the model dropdown.
4. (Optional) If you want to change the default URL that is used to access the Ollama server, you can do so by adding the following settings:

```json
{
  "language_models": {

To do so, add the following to your Zed `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "language_models": {
    "some-provider": {
      "api_url": "http://localhost:11434/v1"
    }
  }
}
```

Where `some-provider` can be any of the following values: `anthropic`, `google`, `ollama`, `openai`.

#### Custom timeout {#provider-timeout}

You can customize the timeout that's used for LLM requests, by adding the following to your Zed `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "language_models": {
    "some-provider": {
      "low_speed_timeout_in_seconds": 10
    }
  }
}
```

Where `some-provider` can be any of the following values: `anthropic`, `copilot_chat`, `google`, `ollama`, `openai`.

#### Configuring the default model {#default-model}

The default model can be set via the model dropdown in the assistant panel's top-right corner. Selecting a model saves it as the default.
You can also manually edit the `default_model` object in your settings:

    "version": "2",
    "default_model": {
      "provider": "zed.dev",
