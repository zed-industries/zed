# Zed on Windows

Zed is not supported on Windows (yet). We have limited developer bandwidth, and a
new platform is a large undertaking. However, the community has developed
a build of Zed on Windows, and you can compile it yourself with these instructions:

- [Building for Windows](./development/windows.md)

Zed Employees are not currently working on the Windows build.
However, we welcome contributions from the community to improve Windows support.
