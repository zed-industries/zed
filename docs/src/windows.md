# Zed on Windows

Zed is not supported on Windows (yet). We have limited developer bandwidth, and a
new platform is a large undertaking. However, the community has developed
a build of Zed on Windows, and you can compile it yourself with these instructions:

- [Building for Windows](./development/windows.md)

We are currently hiring a [Windows Lead](https://zed.dev/jobs/windows-lead).

For now, we welcome contributions from the community to improve Windows support.

- [GitHub Issues with 'Windows' label](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Awindows)
- [Zed Community Discord](https://zed.dev/community-links) -> `#windows`
