# Giving feedback

## Zed repository

We track our issues at [`zed-industries/zed`](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues).

### Feature requests

Try to focus on the things that are most critical to you rather than exhaustively listing all features another editor you have used has.

Command palette: `request feature`

### Bug reports

Try to add as much detail as possible, if it is not obvious to reproduce. Let us know how severe the problem is for you; is the issue more of a minor inconvenience or something that would prevent you from using Zed?

Command palette: `file bug report`

## In-app feedback

Anonymous feedback can be submitted from within Zed via the feedback editor (command palette: `give feedback`).

## Zed forum

Use the [Zed forum](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/discussions) to ask questions and learn from one another. We will be present in the forum and answering questions as well.

## Email

If you prefer to write up your thoughts as an email, you can send them to [hi@zed.dev](mailto:hi@zed.dev).
