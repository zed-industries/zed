# Getting Started

Welcome to Zed! We are excited to have you. Here is a jumping-off point to getting started.

## Download Zed

You can obtain the release build via the [download page](https://zed.dev/download). After the first manual installation, Zed will periodically check for and install updates automatically for you.

## Configure Zed

Use `⌘` + `,` to open your custom settings to set things like fonts, formatting settings, per-language settings and more. You can access the default configuration using the `Zed > Settings > Open Default Settings` menu item. See Configuring Zed for all available settings.

## Set up your key bindings

You can access the default key binding set using the `Zed > Settings > Open Default Key Bindings` menu item. Use `⌘` + `K`, `⌘` + `S` to open your custom keymap to add your own key bindings. See Key Bindings for more info.
