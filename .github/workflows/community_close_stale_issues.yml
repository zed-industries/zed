            Hi there!
            Zed development moves fast and a significant number of bugs become outdated.
            If you can reproduce this bug on the latest stable Zed, please let us know by leaving a comment with the Zed version.
            If the bug doesn't appear for you anymore, feel free to close the issue yourself; otherwise, the bot will close it in a couple of weeks.

            Thanks for your help!
