## 2. TERMS APPLICABLE TO THE EDITOR

### 2.1. License Grant

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Zed hereby grants to You, and You hereby accept from Zed, a term-limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable and non-sublicensable license to make use of the Editor for Your internal use only, and subject to the use limitations in Section 2.2.

## 3. TERMS APPLICABLE TO THE ZED SERVICE

### 3.1. Access to and Scope of Zed Service

If you have elected to use the Zed Service by enabling or activating the Zed Service, Zed will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Zed Service available to You as set forth in this Agreement. Once you elected to use the Zed Service, You may access and use the Zed Service during the Term, subject to Your compliance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement.

### 3.2. Restrictions

You will use the Zed Service only in accordance with all applicable laws, including, but not limited to, laws related to data (whether applicable within the United States, the European Union, or otherwise). You agree not to (and will not allow any third party to): (i) remove or otherwise alter any proprietary notices or labels from the Zed Service or any portion thereof; (ii) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the underlying structure, ideas, or algorithms of the Zed Service or any software used to provide or make the Zed Service available; or (iii) rent, resell or otherwise allow any third party access to or use of the Zed Service. Zed may suspend Your access to or use of the Zed Service as follows: (a) immediately if Zed reasonably believes Your use of the Zed Service may pose a security risk to or may adversely impact the Zed Service; or (b) if You are in breach of this Agreement.

### 3.3. Customer Data

You are solely responsible for Customer Data including, but not limited to: (a) compliance with all applicable laws and this Agreement; (b) any claims relating to Customer Data; and (c) any claims that Customer Data infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates the rights of any third party. You agree and acknowledge that Customer Data may be irretrievably deleted if Your account is terminated. For purposes of this Agreement, "Customer Data" shall mean any data, information or other material provided, uploaded, or submitted by You to the Zed Service in the course of using the Zed Service.

#### 3.3.1. Customer Data Made Available to Zed

To the extent You elect to make Customer Data available to Zed, the same may only be used by Zed according to the Customer Data type and the use rights regarding the same as described herein:

#### 3.3.2. Usage Data

To improve the Editor and understand how You use it, Zed optionally collects the following usage data:

- (a) file extensions of opened files;
- (b) features and tools You use within the Editor;
- (c) project statistics (e.g., number of files); and
- (d) frameworks detected in Your projects

(a-d collectively, "Usage Data"). Usage Data does not include any of Your software code or sensitive project details. You may change Your preferences disabling the collection of Usage Data and You can audit Usage Data collected by the Editor at any time. See [https://zed.dev/docs/telemetry](https://zed.dev/docs/telemetry) for more.

Usage Data is associated with a secure random telemetry ID which may be linked to Your email address. This linkage currently serves two purposes: (1) it allows Zed to analyze usage patterns over time while maintaining Your privacy; and (2) it enables Zed to reach out to specific user groups for feedback and improvement suggestions. Zed may contact You based on Your usage patterns to better understand your needs and improve the Solution. If You delete Your account, the link between Your telemetry ID and Your email address will be permanently removed. By continuing to use Editor or Solution with this feature enabled You agree to this Usage Data collection.

#### 3.3.3. Crash Reports

Customer Data consisting of data related to the behavior of the Solution prior to a crash or failure, such as stack traces are collected and classified as "Crash Reports". Zed will use commercially reasonable efforts to exclude any personally identifiable information from Crash Reports, but due to the nature of a crash, Zed does not ensure that information such as paths will be excluded from Crash Reports. Crash Reports will be used solely for Zed's internal purposes in connection with diagnosing defects in the Solution that led to the crash. You may grant us permission to capture Crash Reports when installing or activating the Solution, and You may change Your preferences at any time in the settings feature of the Solution. Once You grant us this permission, Zed will retain the Crash Reports indefinitely.

#### 3.3.4. User Content

Customer Data consisting of User content created while using the Solution is classified as "User Content". User Content is transmitted from Your environment only if You collaborate with other Zed users by electing to share a project in the Editor. Once You share a project, Zed may transmit User Content consisting of file paths, file contents, and metadata regarding the code returned by language servers. Currently, Zed does not persist any User Content beyond the Your collaboration session. If You unshare a project or disconnect from the Solution, all information associated with such project will be deleted from Zed servers. In the future, Zed may save User Content regarding projects beyond the scope of a single collaboration session. We may share such User Content with those users You elected to grant access to. Zed's access to such User Content is limited to debugging and making improvements to the Solution.

#### 3.3.5. Privacy Policy

You and Zed are bound by the terms and conditions contained in the Zed Privacy Policy which is incorporated by reference hereto. The Zed Privacy Policy is available at the following URL: [https://zed.dev/privacy-policy](https://zed.dev/privacy-policy).
