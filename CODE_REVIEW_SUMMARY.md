- Enables settings system for diff viewer

---

### `src/git_panel.rs`

**What changed:**

- Added 2 new actions: `OpenSplitDiff`, `OpenEnhancedDiff`
- Added 2 context menu entries
- Added 2 new action handler methods
- Simplified `open_diff()` method
- Moved `RepoPath` import to separate line

**Why it's needed:**

- Provides user actions to open different diff views
- Context menu integration for easy access
- Follows existing action pattern in the file
- Clean, production-ready implementation

---

### `Cargo.toml`

**What changed:**

- Added dependencies for diff viewer functionality

**Why it's needed:**

- Required dependencies for new diff viewer functionality
- `text` needed for text manipulation in diffs
- `diff_viewer` is the new crate being integrated

---

### `src/project_diff.rs` (New File)

**What implemented:**

- `ProjectDiff` struct for managing project-wide diffs
- Integration with `DiffViewer` component
- File loading and diff computation logic

**Why it's needed:**

- Coordinates diff viewing for entire project files
- Manages the lifecycle of diff viewer instances
- Handles loading committed vs working file content

---

### `src/split_diff_model.rs` (New File)

**What implemented:**

- Model layer for split diff functionality
- State management for diff viewer interactions

**Why it's needed:**

- Provides data model for split diff user interface
- Manages diff viewer state and interactions

---

### `src/split_diff_settings.rs` (New File)

**What implemented:**

- Settings integration for split diff viewer
- `SplitDiffSettings` struct with configuration options

**Why it's needed:**

- User-configurable settings for diff viewer behavior
- Integrates with Zed's settings system

---

### `LICENSE-GPL`

**What changed:**

- Symlink to `../../LICENSE-GPL`

**Why it's needed:**

- Maintains DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Standard approach for license files in monorepos
- Original symlink structure preserved

---

## 3. `crates/multi_buffer/`

### `src/multi_buffer.rs`

**What changed:**

- Removed cfg attribute to make method public

**Why it's needed:**

- Makes `PathKey::path()` publicly accessible
- Used in `project_diff.rs`
- Method was previously test-only
- Now needed in production code for diff functionality

---

## 4. `crates/project/`

### `src/git_store.rs`

**What added:**

- New method `get_committed_text()`

**Why it's needed:**

- Loads committed (HEAD) version of files for diff comparison
- Handles both local and remote repositories
- Used in `project_diff.rs` to fetch left-side content for diffs
- Backend method `load_committed_text()` already exists in `crates/git/src/repository.rs`

---

## 5. `crates/proto/`

### `proto/git.proto`

**What added:**

- New protocol messages for committed text loading

**Why it's needed:**

- Request/response pair for loading committed file content
- Used in `git_store.rs` for remote repositories
- Follows exact same pattern as `LoadCommitDiff` (field 2 reserved)
- Required for collaborative editing via Zed's server

---

### `proto/zed.proto`

**What changed:**

- Added message registrations to main Envelope

**Why it's needed:**

- Registers new message types in main Envelope
- Sequential numbering: 381 → 382 → 383
- `// current max` comment marks the highest message ID
- Standard protocol extension pattern

---

### `src/proto.rs`

**What added:**

- Protocol message registrations

**Why it's needed:**

- Required registrations for protocol to work
- Without these, proto messages can't be sent/received
- Enables `client.request()` API in git_store.rs
- Follows existing patterns throughout

---

## 6. `crates/settings/`

### `src/settings_content.rs`

**What added:**

- New settings field for split diff configuration

**Why it's needed:**

- Adds `git_split_diff` field to main `SettingsContent` struct
- Positioned logically after `git_panel` (related Git settings)
- Follows same pattern as other optional settings
- Has helpful doc comment for users

---

### `src/settings_content/project.rs`

**What added:**

- New settings types for split diff viewer

**Why they're needed:**

- All types imported and used in `crates/git_ui/src/split_diff_settings.rs`
- Each field maps to `SplitDiffSettings::from_settings()` implementation
- Follows Zed's settings pattern (Content structs + Settings impl)
- Properly derives: `Serialize`, `Deserialize`, `JsonSchema`, `MergeFrom`, `Default`
- Uses `#[skip_serializing_none]` for clean JSON output

---

## 7. `crates/editor/`

### `src/editor.rs`

**What changed:**

- Added diff viewer integration methods

**Why it's needed:**

- Methods to support diff viewer functionality in editor component
- Enables editor to work with diff viewer scroll synchronization

---

### `src/element.rs`

**What changed:**

- Added diff viewer rendering support

**Why it's needed:**

- UI rendering logic for diff viewer component
- Handles the visual layout of side-by-side diff display
